"The cult product lives up to the hype. I've been looking for a peachy pink blush for a while now and this is the first blush that meets my requirements. Due to mixed reviews, I was afraid that Orgasm might be too orange or glittery, but on my fair (NC15 and Sisley 0) skin, it looks like a warm salmon pink. Even though I'm pale, it looks very natural. The glitter is very subtle and on skin, it looks more like a sheen and doesn't highlight pores. 

The texture of the blush is finely milled but not powdery. I have own a Nars blush before, Mata Hari, and the texture was a big disappointment. It was very powdery and left lots of excess product. I don't know if NARS has improved the blush formula in 3 years or is Orgasm different texture-wise, but it doesn't give any excess product.

I bought the limited edition blush, which has great value (3.04 oz, 39 $). The packaging is also very lovely, a vintage picture on the box and on the film in the compact.

"Love this blush. I had been wanting to buy it forever and finally broke down and ordered it from Sephora. Beautiful color and it looks great on me...just a natural pretty pinky hue. It stayed on all day and didn't lose color or anything. Also, went on very smooth.

"This color is what I expected MAC's ""pinch me"" to look like. On my NC30/35 skin it makes me look like I've had a nice long make out session! I can't quite put my finger on what colour it is... I think it's a little red, a little orange and a little peachy. Well, it just looks like the colour of my cheeks after I've pinched it hard.

"I was expecting to like this, given that it works so well for others. I found it to be too sparkly and that it emphasized my pores on my face. The color was quite nice, but a bit too pink for my skin tone. It ended up not being a very flattering shade on my skin at all. But I have seen it on other skin tones and it looks amazing. Just another case of everyone being different. I actually haven't found a shade of nars blush that I like. I loved the color of the nars cream blush penny lane, but it only lasts a couple of hours on my face before it fades.

"I think NARS' Orgasm blush is a great product!  I have very olive/tan skin, (although I tend to be on the lighter side of that spectrum most days of the year), and I think it compliments my skin tone very well.

For my skin color, I would classify it as being a more natural blush.  It is very subtle, perfect for everyday, and gives my face the perfect amount of flush.  I tend to go for darker blushes for some reason, so I forget about this color every now and then.  But once I remember I have it, I never regret it!  The color is very coralesque, and provides its own amount of sheen&shimmer.  If you're not into shimmery blushes, then I wouldn't purchase this product.  But then again, this product can be very subtle, and a little shimmer never hurt anyone!

"Ranked HG material by many, I just had to grab it for myself and find out what all the fuss was about. The brand not being sold in Belgium, I had - like many products I own - to buy it online and rely on existing reviews to make my choice. When ASOS launched NARS on their website this year, including the famous ORGASM blush, this was definitely a sign (free shipping + 20% discount coupon, how could I resist?!). And to crown it all, I found out a few days after I placed my order that ASOS restricted the shipping of this product to UK only... lucky me!
Honestly, I don't have many experiences with blushes so I can't really compare or confirm its status. I can, however, admit it's a very good product, providing you know how to use it: it can be as very pigmented as subtle! I'd strongly recommend using a kabuki brush along the apples of your cheeks for a glowing/healthy look, then lightly finishing off on the apples. When the color sinks after a little while, the name ""orgasm"" suddenly makes sense. The golden sparkles shining within the peachy pink blend perfectly with the skin, leaving what I'd describe as the closest to a natural ""orgasm"" flush effect as you could get.
In terms of staying power, I don't feel the need to reapply during the day but it might depend on the color intensity you want to achieve. It also looks like it'll last for a while, even on a daily basis, since you need just a dab of it to bring color to your face.
The packaging is classy and elegant: matte black, soft to the touch (I'm guessing silicone here) with the white NARS letters on the cover. When you open it, there's a little mirror facing the blush making it handy for outdoor touch-ups and a transparent sheet decorated with the NARS letters in black to protect the makeup.

"I bought this because it is a cult classic. I've wondered every day since I purchased it why it has such a cult following. I am pale with a neutral undertone leaning more towards yellow with blond hair and blue eyes. this, on me, matches my natural flush. but that is the problem. when I wear this, it just makes my face look ruddy. this blush makes me look like I've been jogging and need to put foundation on to cover up the redness on my face. its the look I'm trying to avoid, not create. if I go sheer with this, it looks OK. like a slight shimmer without much color, but still emphasizes the redness in other areas of my face that I try to cover. if I wear this at a medium ish capacity, as I do with other blushes, that's when it looks like I need to go even out my skin with a base. I love the shimmer and glow, despite the fact that I was afraid of the glitter when swatching it in store. however, for over $40 this is a miss for me. it will be going back.

"I decided to give this a try to see what the hype was about.  I'm pretty pale, so I was sure this wouldn't work well on me, but it actually looks about perfect.  A lot of blushes make me look dirty, but this has the right balance of peach and pink tones to look quite natural.

"This blush is super for very pale skintones.  I would not recommend this for anyone over, say, NC25.  I wear Alabaster in Bobbi Brown (~NC15 in MAC, Chantecaille Fresh), and this blush is just a lovely, subtle, everyday blush.  The reviews about it being very subtle are true, but for me that is part of the appeal.  You are never going to get an overdone look with this blush.  The paradox with this blush is that it's hard to really see a difference up close as you're applying it, but step away from the mirror a bit and you will notice a definite glowiness to your cheeks after applying.

"Without a doubt, NARS Orgasm is one of the most hyped products in makeup history.  I've owned various dupes of this color (from NYX, Flirt, Wet n Wild) and I never found the particular shade to have much of an effect on my face.  I was prepared to hate NARS Orgasm when I first tried it.  Honestly, I don't hate it.  That isn't to say that I like it THAT much, either.


I know that this shade has been touted as ""universally flattering.""  I don't think there is a such thing as a one-shade-fits-all product.  However, I would recommend everyone to at least try it (obviously, unless if you do not like shimmer at all).  It's a safe color, and I think it WOULD flatter many people regardless of skin color.  Does it flatter my skin?  Sure, it looks fine.  But is it the kind of color I'm looking for?  No, not really.  Since it's such a safe color, I just feel ""meh"" about it.  I prefer Deep Throat to Orgasm, by miles (I will explain in a bit).  I will say that the texture of the blush is lovely, as with other NARS blushes I've tried.  The dupes I've tried don't compare to the NARS, so this is worth the splurge if you can afford it.



I've seen many comparisons between Orgasm and Deep Throat.  For whatever reason, I experienced the opposite of what many other bloggers did when comparing these two shades.  Orgasm pulls more pink than peach on me (I'm NC27/NARS Fiji, for reference).  I'm thinking MAYBE the gold sheen is what's making it seem more peach.  Still, its base color is a neutral-warm pink.  It's nowhere near orange enough for me to call it a coral.  Deep Throat is a light pink-coral (with a little bit less sheen) on me.

"I have been thinking about buying this blush since last summer and finally took the plunge. I used it everyday last week just so I could give a good review. In the pan it's SO bright. It's a vivid red. Like another reviewer stated, tomato red. I personally love bright fun blushes so this did not intimidate me at all. I used a big fluffy brush and touched the pan, then tapped off the excess, dabbed it on the back of my hand and applied. What I get is a lovely flush of color. The pigmentation is crazy and it literally lasted all day. I'm so frustrated with myself for not purchasing sooner. Now one thing I do have to state is, on my cheeks it looks very similar to Marine Life from Mac, leaning more toward red than coral tho. I love both so I'm ok with owning both.

"This is my HG blush all the way! It's a beautiful peachy-pink with a slight pearliness to it. It looks quite similar in the pan as it does on the cheek, though on the cheek the pearliness nearly disappears. The texture is a little dry in the pan, which I love because it doesn't kick up excess powder, but glides beautifully sheer onto the skin. I'm not a girl that likes a heavily blushed look, and this gives just the right amount of color and wears extremely well through any weather and even the longest of days.

"I'll admit, I didn't purchase this blush with high hopes.  I had found Angelika and Orgasm to be good colors on me and I approached the NARS counter wanting to expend my collection.  As I browsed, everything seemed too dark or muddy for my PPP with cool undertones skin.  The ladies here had recommended Sin and Outlaw so I went back and forth between the two until I settled on Sin.  Sin seemed completely different than either Angelika or Orgasm.  It's kind of plummy and sparkly.  I figured it would be a good direction in which to expand.  (on a whim, I also grabbed Deep Throat, but now I'm wondering if it looks too much like Orgasm)


I wasn't expecting HG material when I swiped it on in combination with a smokey eye and nude glossy lips, but what I got was the perfect muted berry flush.  It wasn't too warm and sunny for my smokey eyes (like Orgasm would have been) and it wasn't too pink and cutesy for my nude lip (like Angelika).  This was one very SEXY blush.  My male friend said he didn't know what it was I did that night, but I was killing him.  I really think it was this blush.  Where my pink and peach blushes make me look fresh, rested, and cute, this made me look like I was sex on wheels in a completely un-trampy way.  Not only did this blush look beautiful, but it also just made me feel confident and a little sassy.  

I like the gold shimmer of this blush.  It makes me look glowy, but doesn't sparkle like a disco ball.  I also didn't have a problem with it accentuating my crater-like pores.  The gold works well with the neutral/cool berry shade.  I think it might lean toward flat or muddy with out that bit of warmth.  


If you're concerned that this blush is too dark, it wasn't for me over NC15 foundation (I'm closer to an NW15 this winter, but the yellow does wonders to even out a bit of red my skin has picked up this harsh winter)  I used this with a very light hand and found I had good control as I built it up for a night out.

"I cannot believe how much I love this blush. I avoided it like the plague for a couple of years because of the glitter, but I decided to try it out a little while ago at my local Sephora and fell in love. I am 41-years-old, so I prudently avoid anything garish. Nonetheless, I decided to try this blush and loved it so much I had to go back the next morning to purchase it.

This is everything I hoped that the original Orgasm blush would be. The color is a gorgeous, golden apricot pink. It is ""rosy"" whereas the original Orgasm is ""orange-y.""

"The reviews say that supposedly this is the universally flattering blush that looks good on everyone, right? I bought it based on that and wore it consistently every day for over a year. I don't remember why I stopped wearing it - cost, perhaps. Now when I look back at pictures of myself from when I was wearing Nars Orgasm blush I can see that I looked totally clownish. I was wearing it on the day I got my last drivers license picture taken and more than one person has (incorrectly) guessed that I had a fever that day. To be sure, I am exceptionally pale - I usually use the lightest or second-lightest shade of foundation - so maybe it was just too much for me or I was applying it too heavily. 

In all fairness, the coverage was excellent and it didn't wear off all day. Unfortunately for me, that just meant that I still looked every bit as much like a clown at 9 pm as I did when I put it on in the morning!

"Amazeballs! At first, when the Sephora cast member recommended me this shade I thought she was perhaps a little bit unhinged. But she turned out to be right! Shows what I know. 

Every time I wear this, my skin looks amazing. My skin looks luminous, I look more alert and it really helps to define and highlight my cheekbones! Extremely flattering for medium skintones!

The only thing I would caution is that it is extremely easy to overdo it with this blush. It's super pigmented, so you only need a tad. Actually, less than that. More like a teensy bit. Otherwise, you run the risk of looking like a clown. 

Good value, though! I've had it for just over a year and I still haven't made a dent on it. It honestly looks like I haven't used it. Because of the crazy pigmentation, I kind of wish NARS made a smaller version of this â€“ maybe make it like a duo like Orgasm/Laguna?

I have other options for a warm glow look, I can find warmth (read, not cool, a little foreign to my coloring) in my stash of Bobbi Brown, Stila, Mally, or Chanel (etc.).

Reminds me of sleek blush in Rose Gold (hint hint dupes) - lovely color a rosy peach with gold - almost- too orange for my NC20/25 Skin tone (too harsh looked like bronzer even when applied lightly) (Asian NC 20 NC 25 in some summers with warm undertones). Nice shade to look at but I think for now I'll stick to light pink blushes which look more natural. Not for those preferring a natural look - in my opinion as shimmery too and I dont think anyones cheeks would be flushing shimmery gold when flushed...depends on look but good product otherwise- alittle on the expensive side like Chanel Blushes but worth it if you find something you will use regularly as make-up tends to expire before you know it.

"Surprisingly enough, this turned out to be my HG of blushes.
I was lucky enough to RIS, and wasn't expecting much from it, since I hate Orgasm with a passion.... however, I was pleasantly surprised with this. The color hows up as a bright pink on me (Similar to Chanel EURO Narcisse and Cargo Catalina) and the glitter isn't visible at all, though I do pat the brush off before applying, which might explain why there's no glitter fallout.

The blush is the most pigmented babydoll pink I've ever owned, and I have to apply it with a very light hand. It's nice because I need to use very little and the amount I have will probably last forever.... It's not nice in that there's a risk of over applying that I don't get with other pink blushes (neither chanel nor cargo are as pigmented).

I have cool-toned skin (which is what this blush is going to look best on), and very, very fair skin (for reference, no MAC foundations are light enough to match me, but some Becca ones are).

"If you're debating whether to get Angelika or Desire, get Desire. 
Shockingly, I had trouble having this show up on my skin. I have an olive complexion (NC42ish), but I never have issues with blushes showing up! Was not expecting this from Nars. When I did get it to show up, I was not thrilled at all. I'm usually wowed by Nars blushes, their colors simply amaze me with how flattering they are on my skin. But this color was plain ordinary..not dynamic at all. Just a basic pink. Shimmery shades usually look better on me than matte, but in this case, Desire looks so much more prettier and somehow more natural. It just compliments my skin better, I suppose. It just didn't even look that pink on me, and it certainly does not resemble the shade it looks like in the pan!

"This blush is very pigmented and blends beautifully.  To avoid putting too much color, I suggest dusting off your blush brush before applying or use a stippling/highlighting brush.  I thought the high amounts of glitter would make the blush chalky but surprisingly, it really doesn't.  Orgasm is pink with peach undertones and looks lovely on my MAC NC 25-30, Shiseido O40, Maybelline Instant Age Rewind, Light#4 Nude skintone.  However,  I don't like the excessive glitter this NARS Orgasm blush has.  I already have large pores on my cheeks and anything containing glitter will only enhance them more.  I prefer matte blushes because they look more natural.  What I also don't like about NARS Orgasm is the high price.  $25 for this one small blush compact seems a little too much.  The coating of the compact allows it to get dirty easily.  I agree with other reviewers that NARS orgasm is overrated (just like most high end brands).  There are excellent cheaper dupes of NARS orgasm like Milani Luminous, Covergirl Rose Silk Blush, and the blush in the ELF studio Blush and Contour compact (Yes..I said ELF).  I owned the dupes and I've compared them to the orgasm.  They're very close and it's not like anyone is going to notice if you're wearing the actual NARs orgasm or its dupe.  Thus,  NARS orgasm isn't anything special but I still give it 5 lippies for the pigmentation and silkiness; nevertheless, I won't be buying it again, and I probably won't have to because it will last me a long time.  As for the staying power of NARS orgasm, it depends on your skin type and if you wear a decent foundation primer.

"Bought this blush after much deliberation since it looks VERY orange in the pan! But now I understand what the hype is about. I don't wear any foundation so I was looking for something that would go on well on bare skin. This definitely does go on well and stays on for several hours. The colour is light and build-able. The sparkles are not noticeable on your skin if you only use a light dusting for a flushed look. It works as a colour and illuminator at the same time. 

So if you hesitate to buy it because of the sparkles, do not worry! They don't show up on the skin like some pre-teen glitter makeup. 

I have only one criticism: I realize that the consistency is the reason it applies so well on the skin but I find that there is way too much being wasted after you sweep a brush across the pan. The powder tends to gather in the frame where the blush pot is actually laid and gets the whole compact messy. For the price, this is a problem. I find that I have to handle the compact VERY gingerly because I'm afraid of making a mess or having the powder crumble.

"Pretty, pink, coral, shimmery this is a lovely blush that looks good on so many people. If you use it sparingly it is appropriate for the office and if you build the colour it is suitable for night.

"Nars described this as ""sheer golden apricot"". Personally, it's kind of hard to describe the color. It's supposed to be a cross between Sertao and Orgasm. I've heard this was the shimmer version of Gina, and the non-pinky version of Orgasm, and the less bronzey version of Sertao. Having Gina, Orgasm, and Sertao already, I think these comparisons are in some ways appropriate, but too reductive to give Luster due credit. You may not be wowed by how it appears on the pan, but once you swipe it across your cheeks, you will believe every single appreciation I have for this blush.  This is probably the most versatile, easy to use blush I have. It's a soft, peachy pink shimmer that looks great under, and over just about anything. Even if you're heavy-handed, this blush will forgive you, unlike most NARS blushes. :) On my skin (NC20) it goes on a golden peach with minimal shimmer. Half golden brown, half true peach - no orange, no pink. Looks very natural and glides on evenly with minimal blending. However, if your skin tone falls under the medium range, I suggest go check out Madly instead.

I know this doesn't work on everyone, but it works on me. I have to be careful to not apply it with a  heavy hand though, if not I look clownish. It gives me a really unique pinky peachy shimmery blush on my fair skin. yes, it does have a lot of shimmer in it in my opinion, so if you don't like shimmer don't buy it. Honestly, I really didn't need to buy any other blush because this color goes with any kind of eye combo you can imagine. Since I'm a product junkie of course i've bought and tried a million other blushes since Orgasm, but Orgasm is hands down one of the most versatile and beautiful blushes I own. I love the shimmer to keep blush from looking too flat. I also own Cargo The BIg Easy, and I think that's more peachy than Orgasm. I just returned Nars Deep Throat because I actually prefer Orgasm better since the color is more bold. Love it, will repurchase if I run out.

"NARS has THE best blushes. I've only tried two so far but those two are extremely pigmented. Super Orgasm is a pretty bright pink with peach undertones and gold sparkles. While I don't care much for the gold sparkles, I can understand how it'd be pretty for nighttime. For daytime, I swirl my brush in the blush and tap to remove the excess. This usually helps to remove most of the gold sparkles, though I do see some here and there on my face. It's nothing garish; I just prefer matte blushes personally. I received this in a swap but I'm not sure if I'd repurchase again due to its exorbitant price (IMO) for a blush. Well, maybe when I get a ""real"" job :P Also, I do think MAC Springsheen is a good dupe, minus the gold sparkles.",0.0,0.0,nars ha the best blush i have only tried two so far but those two are extremely pigmented super orgasm is a pretty bright pink with peach undertone and gold sparkle while i do not care much for the gold sparkle i can understand how it would be pretty for nighttime for daytime i swirl my brush in the blush and tap to remove the excess this usually help to remove most of the gold sparkle though i do see some here and there on my face it is nothing garish i just prefer matte blush personally i received this in a swap but i am not sure if i would repurchase again due to it exorbitant price imo for a blush well maybe when i get a real job p also i do think mac springsheen is a good dupe minus the gold sparkle,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.9947675588649628,0.6095029239766082,0.1572052401746724,0.1417816813048933,0.2503561334087055,0.3708599585062242,0.4756031187864695,ha best tried two far two extremely pigmented super pretty bright pink peach undertone gold sparkle care much gold sparkle understand would pretty nighttime daytime swirl brush tap remove excess usually help remove gold sparkle though see face nothing garish prefer matte personally received swap sure would repurchase due exorbitant price imo well maybe get real job p also think mac springsheen good dupe minus gold sparkle,3

"This is a nice blush, sure, but I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about. The name of the blush seems to be the most interesting part of it, because I really don't see much special here. It's a nice shimmery pinky-peach shade that almost every makeup line seems to have in their arsenal. So as far as the colour goes, I don't think NARS' Orgasm is anything all that unique. There are plenty of dupes out there.
<br><br>
NARS blushes, in general, are really great quality, so if you're just looking for a nice pinky-peach blush, Orgasm is probably a great choice for you. If you're buying it because of the hype about how 'it's a must have shade perfect for every skintone, blah, blah, blah,' it's a pass. If I had come to this blush without such high expectations created by all the hype, I think I would have been really pleased with it, because it is a nice flattering (on me, though I can't imagine it showing on really dark skintones) blush, subtle enough for everyday, but I like other NARS colours better.

"I just LOVE this blush!!!! I wanted to buy a NARS blush that didn't have any shimmer, because I wanted something versatile.  Also I have oily skin, so a shimmery blush in the daytime can make the shine look even worse.  (I use NARS highlighter in Albatross and Luster or Lovejoy blush  for a shimmery effect in the evening). Originally I was going to go for a brown toned blush, but then I saw this color in the pan.  I selected this color because it was the exact same shade in the pan as a t-shirt I was wearing that really looks good on me and brightens up my face.  So I tried the blush in the store and thought it was so pretty.  I bought it with Sephora's version of MAC's #187 skunk brush which makes the application just flawless and makes the blush even prettier.  I use NARS Zen as a contour and the colors work well together.  As other user's have noted, application is critical with NARS blushes.  It makes such a difference!  I find this blush has great staying power and the texture is like silk.  I recommend you try a NARS blush but if you are not sure ask a MUA to help you or to apply a few shades to your skin to see which is best for you.  Even though this blush is pricey and could require the additional purchase of a special brush, it gives you a result that just cannot be achieved with other blushes.  UPDATE: I love this blush more than ever.  Because it is pinky peach, I can wear it with everything (except a smokey eye, then I switch to Madly).  On my NC30 skin it gives the most natural and gorgeous color.  And it lasts all day with no touch ups, which is a miracle for my oily skin.

"I bought this product after reading that Garance Dore (one of my all time fashion idols) uses this blush to give her a bright sculpted look.  As my complexion and colours are similar to hers, I thought I would give it a try.  Looking at the product in store, my initial thought was that it looks like a dark earthy pink/red.  I usually stick to either pale or cool and clear shades, so I was a bit concerned this would not suit my neutral, fair to medium complexion (my shades are Chanel 20, Clinique Fresh Ivory 02, Bourjois 52, MAC NC20).  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is actually a really flattering warm coral pink once applied.

"Dolce Vita makes my life very sweet indeed!  I did not expect anything less from the wonderful people over at NARS.  DV is a dark matte blush that is very much a burnt rose with subtle hints of red lurking in the undertones.  I've currently use it on several of my customers ranging from PPP to DDD.  As with many NARS blushes it is extremely pigmented but can be applied sheer and is easy to build.  On my fairer clients I use a stippling (skunk) brush to impart pinched/cold flush.  If applied right even the scariest blush can look natural.  So please be gentle with your application; it can easily turn ruddy if not applied well.  I highly recommend this color for GGG's and DDD's.  I know sometimes it can be hard to find blushes that work...I've used it on myself (DDD) and received many compliments that day from several different MA's.  It is the newest addition to my kit and I will continue to buy!

"So many YouTubers have recommended this shade that I just had to try it. And it is certainly worth the hype. I know generally the most popular/advertised NARS blush shade is Orgasm but Madly is just a beautiful shade of, what they call, seashell pink.

I find it pulls a dark peachy pink on my skin and looks so different from any of the other blushes I own. It takes some of my makeup looks from standard to gorgeous. It has just enough shimmer to keep it interesting and be used on it's own without a highlight. It builds so well and wears well too.

"I typically gravitate towards plums and shimmery blushes, but I opted for Amour on my wedding day.  Amour is a matte medium toned ""peachy pink"" and given that NARS blushes are famously pigmented, I think this would work on a wide range of skin tones.  I believe I am a MAC C4 and this quite flattering on my warm-leaning skin tone.  I neglected to thoroughly blend this blush on my wedding day, so it ended up looking quite garish, but on most days, it blends beautifully and is probably more natural looking than my usual preferred plummy check hues.  

I don't think Amour is terribly unique, but NARS blush formulation is one of my favorites - the longevity is great and it applies smoothly and evenly.  

The packaging sucks.  Now that I've had my NARS blushes for several years, the rubberized texture on the compacts have broken down, resulting in that tacky ""attracts all kinds of dust and fingerprints"" appearance and feel.  For $30 a blush, I would expect better packaging.

"PRODUCT
+ Lovely peachy-pink which looks natural and lovely.
- Way too much glitter for me for natural days, which sucks because the coloring itself is very nice. Just gotta apply with light hand! 
+ Relatively fine powder, easy to apply. 
+ Eliminates need for a highlighter for a quick blush. 
- At the same time, you can't really control the amount of highlight you get... 

PRICE
- A little expensive for the product, right in between MAC/Bobbi Brown price and the higher Chanel/Dior brands, but not that much of a greater jump from MAC in quality. 

PACKAGING
+ Nice, sleek, chic, and a relatively big mirror is a major plus. 
- On the other hand, NARS compacts get dirty and nasty so fast and I routinely have to clean it up with make up remover. Gross. Major loss of points.

For me this product does live up to the hype. A beautiful peachy pink blush with gold shimmer that is highly pigmented amd blends  like a dream (like most NARS blushes). It gives the most gorgeous flush of colour that compliments my blue eyes. This blush works when I'm fair/medium in the winter and when Im tanned in the summer. Although I can sometimes look a little too shimmery in the natural daylight at times but forgivable without highlighter and minimal bronzer.

I was in Sephora about a year ago buying a new foundation, and as always, I wanted to peruse the NARS blushes. I cannot go into Sephora with out visiting them, it is the makeup junkie's way of smelling the flowers. My eye was just drawn to Exhibit A, and the second I saw it I decided it was for me. Why? Because it looked like a challenge. So I put it on hold, went home and read reviews and went back to get it in the next few days.... and WOW!!! It is amazing. It is my first NARS blush and I am so, so in love with it. 
When I purchased it I was only wearing it occasionally because I was watching all these tutorials with more of a peachy, coral look. But two months ago I put it back in my main makeup bag, and I cannot go back. This blush makes me look alive, and that is it. The light red gives me the perfect, flirty glow that I have been looking for. Yesterday I tried doing my peach blush (Milani Luminous) and I felt so boring.

"Absolutely love this stuff! First and foremost, this is the prettiest shade of peach blush I ever saw! Before this I was using Smashbox's peach blush and it was too much. Orgasm is the perfect peach: light enough to look natural, but pigmented. I will say, this is one of the few blushes where you can add coverage. I say this because the golden/shimmery effect doesn't show with one stroke. If you add on, it will really shine, but it won't look unnatural.

In my opinion this deserves all the hype.  Its a lovely pinky peach with shimmer.  I personally love the shimmer.  As a previous reviewer wrote its not OTT for day but equally luminous for a night out and gives my cheeks a lovely shape and dimension esp with highlighter on cheekbones.  Its not very pigmented which i take as a good thing cos it can be built up better than very pigmented blushes which are very easy to overdo.

"I use Madly every single day. It's one of those products that I can't leave home without. It's great for very pale people, just to give some color, or contour, or as it's intended purpose. It gives a great, natural glow. I always try to start with a contouring technique when applying it, but then I usually end up putting it basically all over my face (lightly) and then putting a color like Oasis on the apples of my cheeks. It's not the train wreck that it sounds like, it actually ends up being quite gorgeous :)

I can't speak for people of varying skin tones, but for extremely fair skin, it's wonderful. If you have medium-to-dark tones, I'd give it a try in store. NARS can really surprise you with how universally flattering so many of their colors and products can be, you just have to work with them a bit. But I can say for a fact that this is a MUST for PPP.

"This is another example of something I would have never bought for myself if I hadn't had my makeup done by someone else.  I thought I would never get over my love for Torrid.  Torrid and I have been seeing eachother every day since purchase.  I tried to stray with Lovejoy and Orgasam but I kept coming back to beloved Torrid, it felt wrong to use something else.  I wanted to get a few things so I made an appt at the NARS counter.  I wasn't overly impressed with the MA (I miss Elaine @ Neimans St. Louis, where did she go??), but LOVED her choice of blush on me.  I have always been told I am a warm toned girl, I would have thought this blush way to cool for me but it really brightens me up and gives me a lovely glow.  The sparkles would also turn me off, but they don't show up on your face like they do the pan.  So for now, I am cheating on my trusty Torrid with Angelika and quite liking it!

"I Have a few Nars blushes and this would be one of my favourites, though unlike my other Nars blushes this does not last on me all day, if I'm going out later on I always need to touch this one up to re-freshen it a little and bring some colour back.

On my NC15 yellow under-toned skin this gives me a pretty soft peachy-pink with subtle gold highlight glow that buffed in well looks like natural healthy slightly flushed skin. As I am more on the fair side I don't need much of this blush to build up the colour - I find two applications with the brush tapped off for each cheek is more than enough and even though it does give a bit of a glow I still like to high-light minimally over this blush.  I love the effect of the Nars multiples - especially ""Luxor"" over this blush.

"For a long time I've been wanting to try NARS' blushes but haven't really gotten around to them cuz (1) I USED to not bother with applying blush (not anymore now that I've got Deep Throat lol) and (2) I wanted to finish my Lancome's Blush Subtil in Cedar Rose first.
So finally I got annoyed with Lancome's cuz the blush was turning hard and got Deep Throat! I know there's all this hype about the Orgasm blush, but after comparing them, I actually prefer Deep Throat more cuz it's got a bit more pigment and does not have as much shimmery glitter as Orgasm (I have oily skin, so I don't want too much glitter when I'm already an oil-slick lol).

"Why did I wait so long to try this?!  Years ago (many wrinkles ago!) I used Orgasm and loved it with my dark auburn hair, but as I aged it just looked wrong on me.  My hair turned silvery and makeup with too much shimmer just accented my skin's imperfections.  So, I always passed Sin by because I noticed shimmer.  And frankly it doesn't look that pretty in the pan, sort of dull.  However, I love blush and find it the one thing that really perks up my aging (54 years old ) face.  I am an NW20, but with weird coloring.  My skin is coolish/neutral but I can easily wear some warmish toned blushes, but the real problem is that I have strange, purplish, highly pigmented lips which contrast with the blushes that look good on me.  A few weeks ago during a Christmas shopping trip I went into Sephora looking to treat myself and a new blush is a cheap thrill.  I looked at the different NARS blushes, and Sin didn't really catch my eye. The SA told me it looked different on and swiped some on my cheeks.  Awhile later while I was shopping I caught a glimpse of myself in a mirror and loved it!  It's perfect!  Went back and bought it and have worn it every day since.  It just pulls my whole face together, it's a very natural color for me.  I am pretty fair and it is highly pigmented, so I don't need a lot.  When it's on, c I don't really notice any shimmer, but I do blend well.  BTW it looks very good applied lightly with UD Rapture lippie.  I will definitely re-buy because it's the best blush I have worn in many years.

It is the ultimate in summertime beauty.  I don't know what this would look like on a skintone that is paler and maybe with more pink tones to it, but on my caramel-coloring it looks fab.  The wear is fairly exceptional, by the end of day I need to touch up but it has lasted fairly well through this insanely humid summer.  Another concern I had was that because it isn't matte, that it would make my oily skin look oiler, but as long as I don't put it too far inward on the apples of my cheeks, I have no problems.  I doubt I will ever NEED to repurchase, but if I ever did run out I would definitely buy it again.

"I much prefer Deep Throat to Orgasm (wow--could that sentence have been any dirtier?) Orgasm was a little too shimmery for me, and on 'off' days it would acquire this oddly ruddy tone. That plus the gold glitter made Orgasm sort of...hard-looking. Deep Throat is much prettier and more natural-looking. It's a vivid coral in the pan, but on my AAB skin, it's a rather sheer, light peachy color with a tiny touch of pink and some very subtle gold microshimmer. It's like a really toned-down version of Orgasm, harder to overdo, and has a sweeter, girlier effect. If Orgasm is a Vegas showgirl, then Deep Throat is the head cheerleader. If Orgasm didn't work on you and you are still yearning after a NARS blush, check this one out. I can't imagine this NOT working on anyone. My only complaint is that the lasting power is not particularly good, with maximum wear-time being perhaps 4-5 hours on me, even with my skin as dry as it is these days.

"Firstly I would like to say that the only reason I bought this blush was because I had heard so many good things about it and because it's a cult favorite.

"I love Nars blush in Angelika... it is the ultimate girlie blush and with the most insignificant sweep over your cheeks it gives you a gorgeous glow. Don't let it's sparkling appearance intimidate you!

You only need to use a very small ammount as it's highly pigmented- so you know that it's going to last more than a few weeks which makes it worth every penny. This is by far the bestblush i have ever owned! And i'm glad that it is as it's worth $60AU.

It has a flawless light pink shade that's quite buildable and it just gives my face this refreshed natural glow. I love this blush because I put it on before 6 am and it wears on till I remove my makeup 12 hours later. I used MAC PeachyKeen before and it just fades after 4 hours.

"So, I also got into Nars Blushes apparently...  I never was a blush person, i always used one, but had just one two i chose quite randomly when i was buying other stuff - typically at the Clinique counter... Now that i have seen, how popular these are, I went to see the shades and to investigate, what shade i could try.
I am NW15-NW20, quite fair and i like subtle look on the cheecks, so i chose Douceur, but it wasnt at the shop and i wanted something immediately, so i asked the SA to recommend something for me. She recommended Orgasm, but to me it was too glittery and obvious so i had a look around and found Deep Throat that really to me seems to be a subtle easily wearable version of Orgasm. It is more pink than peach on me and reminds me a bit of my old Clinique Cupid blush. The differnce is though that DT is much finer and it is super easy to blend and is very pigmented.

"I ditched orgasm a long time ago because it made me look sallow.  Even though it's supposed to be pinker than deep throat, the gold flecks ruined it for me.  
I'm fair/light and this color is perfect.  It reminds me of Lillium by Stila, but in powder form.  It's a very flattering peachy-pink.  You can build color, it's got some (but not too much) shimmer, and it blends well.  I tried this on one cheek and Benefit's Throbb on the other and this one looked natural, while the other just sat on top of my skin.
If I ever run out, I will buy this again.  I've been using it for two weeks and I can hardly tell from looking at the package.  I reapply once or twice during the day.  I  could complain that it doesn't last all day, but I have oily skin, so nearly nothing does.

"I needed to revamp my blushes this summer summer since my addiction to faux tan turned my spring nw30 into tipping almost over nc43. So I already own 2 nice hot pink MAC blushes but wanted some warmer options so I chose nars Exhibit A and Taj Mahal (reviewed separately). Exhibit A is great cuz it’s a natural flush and used with a light hand will work any skin tone any season. Yes it’s fire engine red in the pan. It looks so fun to me I guess scary to some, if you’re say an nw20 like I am in the dead of winter just use a slight smidgen. Since it IS the color one flushes naturally, you don’t really have to worry about matching the rest of your makeup to it. Which is nice. It is definitely noticeable on dark skin of you use it like you’d use a “normal” blush (this is a “paranormal” blush Haaaa). Nothing but good things to say.

"Admittedly I was skeptical as I usually am when people RAVE about a product but after hearing my MUA friend go on about how Orgasm would be a great color for me I hit up the local Sephora and dropped the $ for it.  In store, under the fluroscent glow, I was still skeptical but figured WTH, why not.  

A full year later this is my review: this is my go to blush for almost every day.  Yes I still use Clinique's Peony (which also is a bit peachy toned) but there is something magical about Orgasm.  The glittery look in pan goes on the skin as a glow.  I've taken my hair from a dark blonde/almost brown to a lighter golden blonde and the blush looks even MORE amazing with my skin with my lighter hair color.   I've worn the blush in the height of winter (aka: I'm very pale) and in the height of summer (aka: I got pretty tan this summer) and it's STILL my go to color.  I like brushing it lightly all over for just some OOMPH.  I like using it on my eyelid creases on those days when I want just a simple eye without too much fanfare but i still want to maintain a glow.  This blusher is THAT good.

I can't type much more that is different than raves for it.  In my history of cosmetic usage I don't think I've gone through a blusher as quickly or as happily.

"If you are one of the many make up junkies with an Olive/Tan complexion that wasn’t satisfied with Nars’ Orgasm, then I highly recommend purchasing Torrid which I deem to be the Orgasm for girls with darker complexions. Torrid is a true coral blush shade with a golden shimmer. As with most of Nars’ blushes, only a light hand is needed for a pigmented color payoff. I am an NC42 in MAC and this blush gives me a pleasant and healthy looking glow. Even by just wearing this blush on my face alone, my complexion is immediately brightened.

"With over 2000 reviews for this blush, I wouldn't have thought I'd be bothering to write a review upon receiving it in my Valentine's Day blush binge (Orgasm, TheBalm Hot Mama and NARS Angelika), but it is so amazing on my NW20 complexion that I couldn't help but sing it's praises.  

I resisted this purchase for the past 2 years.  I'd pass by it in Sephora at least once a month and dismiss it as too peach for my pink complexion and too expensive (I was a student with no income until last summer with a Sephora 5 blocks from my apartment. . .absolute torture)  I figured there was no way it could live up to the hype.  I figured it was an ordinary product with a catchy name. ss

When I received it today, I rushed home at lunch to give it a try.  In the pan, it didn't look like anything special.  I started to regret my purchase.  I was feeling particularly sallow because I hadn't bothered with makeup at all this morning (the horror) so I was ready for blush.  Any blush.  Even this blush that I was starting to regret purchasing.  

I was amazed at how easy it was to get this blush right-no blotchiness, no stray pigment where I didn't want it.  The color was absolutely perfect.  I couldn't have imagined a more perfect, natural color.  The shimmer didn't look like shimmer from a normal distance, it just made me look glowy, healthy and awake.  I looked like I had slept 9 hours, had a great workout, soaked in a hot bath and spent an hour in the sun.  I had been stuck in a pink rut (hence the purchase of Angelika) because I once had a Sephora MA tell me that I had to eliminate brown from my blush and lipstick choices.  Orgasm is a peachy-pink without any brown to muddy it.  I think this is why it works so well on my skin.  

In addition to making me look glowy and healthy, it made my green eyes pop and sparkle.  It might be my imagination, but I felt like my dark brown hair looked richer when wearing this blush.  

Overall, if you haven't tried it because you're skeptical of the hype, it's worth a look.  I'm really glad I gave it a try.

"Luster is my new favorite Nars blush and my new favorite blush in general.  I have an amateur's Nars collection comprising Lovejoy, Orgasm, Sin, and Oasis.  Luster didn't have the ''curb appeal'' of these other iconic blushes, thanks to its comparatively dull, brown-based apricot tones.  It lacked the lift and overt sparkle of the others, and I wasn't quiet certain that my skin wasn't too sallow for this color family.

After losing count of how many times I tested Luster in Sephora, I bought it.  Compared to my other blushes (including similarly iconic Bobbi Brown Coral), Luster is the only one that doesn't ''pop'' off my skin.  Salesclerks will tell you that is the whole point, this pop, but on me it translates into the color not integrating with my own.  Popping is just another way of announcing, I have on lots of candy-colored blush, sometimes with sparkles.

Luster works brilliantly with my favorite faux-tan product, Fresh High Noon.  In this combination, Luster appears to be emerging from within my cheeks, not sitting on top of them.  It simply appears as if I have some sun color in the form of a bit of flush.  It's extremely realistic on me and belies my earlier suppositions that apricot was an unnatural color for me thanks to my skin's tonal qualities.  I'd go so far as to say that Luster even looks dewy on me, something none of my other blushes do. The shimmer is minimal, but is not milled into the product.  There is no frostiness as there is in Orgasm and I haven't found Luster to build up the way Orgasm does.  It does seem to have a moister texture than my other powder blushes and it appears that way on the face.

"Expensive but does last a very long time. I also love to use this is an eyeshadow as well as a blush - its really pretty on the eyes especially with lots of mascara or made slightly smokey with a brown eyeshadow in the crease.

 I would repurchase because the colour is suprisingly flattering on my (nc43) skintone which I didn't expect from something pinky peachy with shimmer.

The shimmer is really quite subtle when it goes onto the skin and gives off a 3D sort of highlight/glow rather than a glitterball effect. The blush is very pigmented so I just apply bit by bit and build the colour depending on whether I'm just doing my every day make up or going out somewhere.

"This is a dreadful blush, it cakes to a hard pebbly surface in the pan. For an expensive blush that is hard to forgive and forget. I notice it among all the other NARS blushes all of which maintain a nice surface. This one looks like it's made of grit and pebbles.


I've noticed this at more than one NARS counter on more than one occasion.


On me it turns into clown cheeks instantly no matter how little goes on. I'm not good with heavily pigmented blushes, I have some rosacea in my cheeks, 


but peachy pinks are usually something I can wear, just not this one.


Worst is the neon flashy ""I'm wearing blushy blush"" hooker cheek look this gives me.


Not so for everyone, I keep reading in magazines that this is the best, and the most universal blush, but looking at the top picks in the blushes here on MUA thankfully gives other better choices for women like me.


For women with rosacea or sensitive skin, proceed with extreme caution, don't buy sight unseen, and test it very lightly at the counter, and even then try it a few times before buying.

OK EDITED TO ADD: It's July 2016 and I got a sample of this blush again in the Allure magazine. My original assessment is unchanged except that with the sample, it's a nice glowy warm pink. Not as radioactive and bright as before, somewhat easier to blend. I don't know if the formula has changed or my skin has. As before, I applied it over foundation and setting powder to ensure a smooth even application.

BUT--- It lands a ton of shine on the cheeks, spotlighting all the crowsfeet around where my cheekbone and eye meet. AND it's has visible chunks of gold glitter in amongst the very shiny sheen it plops on my cheeks.

"Brown girls: you need this. I am sure this is flattering on just about any skin tone, as long as you apply it right, but I think this is one of those essential shades that all brown girls need because it looks AMAZING on our skin tone (I'm Paki). And in general, it is a great shade for those with medium to darker complexions! I think it was even awarded ""Best Blush for Olive Skin"" by InStyle.

Torrid is different enough to be unique from the other Nars shades (I would know, I own way too many..). It's very very pigmented so be careful when you apply. It's a stunning, coral golden-y shade. The texture is soft and buttery and it applies like a dream. The gold shimmer is pretty subtle, so no worries for the glitter-wary. I don't think it's that comparable to Orgasm, but if you're generally looking for this kind of shade, Torrid is the clear winner (orgasm has more pink, more visible glitter, and the color doesn't show up very well - although I do love orgasm for what it is). This is one of the prettiest shades I own and I just love wearing this. Currently trying to get as much use out of this as possible until winter hits..

"<br>
madly is my all time fav blush from nars & forever will be <3
<br>
it was a task to find this on mua. I wanted to swap for it because I was just getting into nars & the price was a lot to me for a blush. but I was fortunate to swap with a swet girl, when I got madly in the mail I opened it and fell in ""mad"" love =0] <br>
 now im officially hooked on nars xx
<br>
nars blushes are made with such high quality. the powder is so finely milled. super soft. and ohh soo pigmented! u barely need to touch the product and you have so much on your brush.<br>
madly is what nars described as a ""seashell pink"" and at first I didn't see the pink. but in the sunlight, the pink comes thru & boy is it beautiful! but the main reason madly is so pretty is because of the main color.. a gorgeous tan/bronze/beige with irredescent shimmer. there's some green shimmer [tiny sparkles] and with the tan blush it gives a nice olive glow. just enough pink and brown in one blush=perfection!
<br>
I wear this almost everyday. you can't go wrong. it matches everything in my makeup stash. I use either my mac 188, 116 or my nars ita long handle kabuki. which is a whole other review. but its a wonderful brush made for nars blushes. it picks up just the right amount of product so you never over-do it. [since nars is so pigmented] any of these brushes work great. and I use it as my blush & bronzer so I just apply it to my apples and as a contour. a little on my jawline and im done.
<br>
this is the best product to have when ur in a hurry and just want to be polished, it looks like you spent a lot of time when it takes mere seconds. this would work great for al skin tones. I would check it out at sephora if you can. but if you can't. just order it or swap for it. its completely worth the risk.

"I am not very adventurous when it comes to makeup because usually I have my set of products that I'm happy with and I don't usually go out to try out new things. 
However I decided to go for a new blush because I wasn't happy with my MUFE #18 blush anymore because during winter my face tends to show more redness and I felt that the blush accentuated the redness under my foundation so I decided I wanted to go for a more peachy pink colour and after looking at all the reviews I decided that I wanted to give the NARS Deep Throat a try (I was almost going to buy Orgasm but found it a little too intense as an everyday blush).

This blush has a really beautiful peachy pink colour which I find is a more wearable version of Orgasm. It is a shimmery blush which I was a bit wary of because I prefer matte blushes since I have oily skin and I don't like my face to look shiny/oily so I stay away from any shimmer or glitter on my face. It does look glittery in the packaging but once you put it on it looks really natural and it has great staying power so I don't need to touch up during the day.

"The “Markle Sparkle” prevails! Meghan Markle loves this blush (the duchess of Sussex). And it’s easy to see why! It’s a super easy to wear peachy golden sheen. It gives my face light. I bought this full size (I was a NARS virgin! Meaning I got my first NARS product when I bought “O!!” Keep that dirty mind in check!!), got Laguna/“O” duo (which is MIA arghhh I hate when I lose MU esp expensive MU!!), & a 100 Point Sephora perk mini (I keep that 1 in my purse). That & NARS Gouele blush (received as a vib-R gift from Sephora hitting rouge. Cute idea to actually give out rouge!! I wish they had this size for sale in a set of blushes bcoz I’d so buy them! Who ever finishes a blush besides my DM who I have more makeup in my purse than she owns, period. That’s novel use up one item then replace it? Wtf. Um, no!!) are my go-to blushes (my Meghan look requires NARS “O,” MAC kohl in velvet teddy, tom ford platinum creme eyeshadow, Fresh lipbalm, & showing off my freckles. My Kate look involves gouele blush, tom ford kohl for lower lashline, & Bobbi Brown Sandwash Pink lipstick. I love the styles of the royals & I have done much research into what products these 2 ladies favor as they are my fave style icons). “O” is so good I thought my mom would enjoy [the color, not name] of this & an elf kabuki (spent all the money on the product couldn’t afford a high end brush at the time & she loves the EL blush & brush that came w that. Turns out she didn’t like “O” as to why I’m not really sure I guess because it wasn’t Estée Lauder (her fave high end brand). I’ll prob end up inheriting it back but it’s fine I’m just sorry she didn’t like it. I’m NC20 (MAC) 2W1 “Dawn” (ELDW) N3 (L’Oréal TruMatch) to give a few examples I’m a bit of a mismatch as God gave me warm skin yellow toned w freckles but my natural hair color (I don’t dye it so I know. Word.) is light brown ashy not a bit of red & when I got highlights in 2015 they were platinum no red. So my skin has a ####-ton of freckles from since I can remember (when I was really little, my nanny used to pretend to count them they were called “angel kisses” from her), warm & light-med & my hair color ashy brown oh & my eyes are grey. Not icy blue like 1 might think but actually grey like concrete sometimes flash green when I’m mad. I’m 100% Caucasian (I did 23andMe DNA), but this blush flatters my skin-hair so much. If I use too heavy of a hand it will go metallic so I try to keep it light. I don’t want to look like The Tin Man’s ####!! If you do go overboard easy to fix: a super fluffy brush w some loose powder. Best to add a little blush at a time until full frontal result is achieved then try to take away (it wastes your good money wasting blush/powder too! I am a frugal gal. My makeup is come by dearly for me. So I try not to waste it.) although I’ve had “O” for 3 or 4 years now I’ve not even made a dent in any 3 of mine [nor my mini VIB-R NARS gouele blush that convinced me I needed the full size no dent in either] but I shopped my stash recently found these & realized they’d be great for my royals emulation (Kate does a deep red blush not Exhibit A but gouele is good if u want her look). Anybody can wear “O” it’s not super warm nor overly coolish neither. It’s a cult classic; it should own its own twitter page! By far the most famous NARS product AND most famous blush that comes to mind. Who comes up w these strange names? I’d be embarrassed if some stranger or even my mom, complimented my makeup—I’d be mortified to tell any1 the name of the blush! Can’t they do “places” like elf (St Lucia is the elf dupe for this but don’t worry if u shelled out the big bucks for the original. It’s not a 100% dupe)  or colors (“golden peach,” anyone?). This & NARS Gouele are tied for my fave blushes. Ahhh I can’t think to decide!! A side note: the packaging is sleek & appealing, doesn’t take up all the room in ur MU bag; has a mirror, but no brush. For this price they should throw in a token brush for travel. The compact is easy to open w my fake nails, protects the blush (I’ve not dropped it but the mini lives in my bag so it travels well. I will always have this in my stash til they quit making it! <3 this blush........“O” is #downtowntriplecrown #winning #RunDontWalkToSephora #marklesparkle #OneForEveryOne

"<p>At first, I hesitated buying Torrid. I already have Deep Throat and read from a lot of reviews here that this is just a darker/deeper version. However, since I've been going through a blush phase lately, I was not able to resist. </p>


<p>It's true, IMO this is a slightly more coral version of DT. More intense and more peachy/orangey as opposed to DT which is pinky peach. Both have slight red undertones and look shimmery in the pan. But, do not be fooled - this applies with a natural sort of ""glow from within"" look.  This also makes me look soooo healthy and alive.</p>


<p>I prefer using this at night when I want more ""oomph"" and Deep Throat during the day if I want something more subtle. For reference, I am NC20-25.

"Oh, Orgasm -- the one blush that every other blush on the planet seems to be compared to. For months, I'd research dupes, since there are a decent amount of blushes that are like Orgasm from almost every budget. Then it occured to me if I stopped spending money on dupes I could buy the real thing. First, the color is the most gorgeous pop of pink with gold shimmer throughout - no ""sparkles"" or chunky glitter here. But - I hate matte blushes so the golden shimmer/sheen doesn't bother me at all. Did angels sing when I put this on for the first time? Eh.. No. But I had to buy it to see what the hype was about. It gives a nice peachy pink color with the gold shimmer which provides a nice sheen so it's not completely flat - but it's not overdone so it doesn't make you look greasy either. As far as dupes go... I tried ELF's Candid Coral - not a dupe at all, just chalky and cheap. Milani Luminoso - the blush is very pigmented, but very powdery. Just a pink peach with a sheen - no gold so to speak, and I detect a bit more peachy orange than Orgasm. Lastly, there is NYX Pinched. The pinched that I own is a bit more reddish-pink in color and does have a golden sheen. When swatched, Pinched isn't as sheer as Orgasm, but the gold shimmer is a bit more chunky. It's not as finely milled as Orgasm, where Orgasm leans more peachy-pink and Pinched more pinky-red. Also, Orgasm is very sheer - which is nice, as I don't really need to pile it on. To be honest, as a college student on a budget I probably wouldn't repurchase when I finish this. I could recreate the glowy look by wearing a peachy blush with a gold highlight on top.

"I was so excited to try this since this is the NARS blush that receives the most hype. But I was so disappointed with it. 
Firstly, it was way too glittery. It did not look glittery indoors when I was doing my makeup but once I saw my reflection outside in the natural sunlight, I looked like I slapped glitter on my face. Even my friends were asking me if I applied glitter that day...
Secondly, I didn't find this blush pigmented enough. It took me multiple swipes to get colour on my brush which was very annoying. I simply don't have time in the morning to swipe the blush multiple times for each side of my cheek. That said, I do have very soft blush brushes (Hakuhodo blue squirrel) so maybe other blush brushes made of goat hair will work better on this blush. 

I have since tried Deep Throat, which is way better. Much more pigmented and not glittery. Nice coral pink shade. Check that one out if you are after a coral pink colour instead of this.

"So I was in Sephora, and asked the SA to help me find a good blush for everyday. She showed me a few Stila blushes and a few NARS blushes, but once I saw Amour i was in love.  It is a bright matte pink/peach that warms up my face.  It is the first blush I've tried that doesn't bring out the redness in other parts of my face. The texture feels velvety smooth and soft on skin. It blended beautifully with a fluffy blush brush. I found that it wore off in only a couple of hours.  But I've found that If you put the blush on before your setting powder it lasts a lot longer.  The only cons are the price and the packaging. Although it was expensive at $24, it feels worth it for the number of times I instinctively reach for this blush.  As many people have said about the NARS packaging, the rubberized case looks super sleek and adorable, but is impossible to keep clean. My compacts all look disgusting after only a couple of uses. A small drawback to an amazing product.

"Lately I've found myself with a taste for bright, vibrant blushes. I find that when applied and sheered out, they really brighten up any complexion. After purchasing countless hot pinks and bright corals, I was on the hunt for a true red blush. I know that Illamasqua ans Sleek make red blushes, but those brands are not sold in my area, so I was stumped....Until a recent trip to Sephora when I noticed NARS 'Exhibit A'.


I'm already a huge fan of NARS blushes. Yes they're pricey, but I just love how rich and pigmented they are and it seems to be damn near impossible to look ""overdone"" while wearing a NARS blush since they apply so soft and pretty. The only possible complaint that I can think of is that they do contain lanolin and talc...Making them comedogenic. This doesn't bother me since my skin is resilient and I don't really ""break out"".


Anyhow, 'Exhibit A' is best described as a true, matte orange-based tomato red. I originally thought that it would only suit deeper complexions since it's so vibrant, but after typing it into Google images I realized that this blush is wearable for almost ALL complexions: Cool-toned alabaster white, deep chocolate brown, true beige, warm olive ......And me, warm tan/light brown. Whatever your complexion is, this blush is guaranteed to provide a soft, natural looking (yes, NATURAL looking) glow to the complexion. I'm shocked that this blush is able to provide such a sweet glow since it has no shimmer. 


Anyhow, as a caution to anyone considering purchasing this blush, please oh please apply it with a stippling brush. You literally need only tap this brush into the pan to pick up enough color for both cheeks since it's so highly pigmented.


Also, you need to be quite careful when choosing lip colors to go with this blush. You cannot pair it with pink, plum or peach lips, which is why this blush is not HG or an everyday blush for me (as much as I love it). This blush is best paired with a red lip (halleluja because I'd been looking forever for a blush to wear with my beloved red lipstick) or a nude lip. Actually, even if you're wearing no additional makeup, this blush is great to pop onto the cheeks for a warm, healthy, ""in love"" glow as I call it. This blush reminds me of the flush in one's cheeks after engaging in certain ""acts"" (sorry for being a little raunchy, but that's really the look that this blush creates).


To sum it up? This blush is not necessary, it's not HG, it's pricey as hell....But it's definitely something beautiful to try if you are looking for an addition to a blush collection. 5.5 for 'Exhibit A', my fourth (and certainly not last) NARS blush.

"I just LOVE madly blush. I got it in a swap and it was one I overlooked (Wrongly!). I already have Deep Throat, Amour, and Mata Hari for other NARS blushes.  Madly and DT are on the lighter, less pigmented, easy to wear spectrum of NARS blushes. I have to use more of these and they end up looking more natural than my other more pigmented NARS blushes. Anyway, Madly is a tannish peachy pink color with shimmer. The shimmer looks prominent but when you put it on you really can't notice the shimmer except for a nice glow.

"For as much as my NARS blush stash renders me a legit candidate for A&E's Hoarders, I always passed over Dolce Vita; while it is lauded as being one of the most universally flattering shades, the lipstick of the same name always pulled orange-ish terra cotta on me, rather than ""dusty rose."" As a cool, ghostly NW5-10, warm terra cotta just does not generally do me any favors...


That said, I felt pangs of remorse after reading a rave blog post about it, after which I felt sorry for having been dismissive -- and that's how Dolce Vita came to live in my stash through a swap. I am very pleased with the addition!


As is the case with most NARS blushes, I have to use a stippling brush with this one -- it is very heavily pigmented and entirely matte; there is no shimmer at all. On the skin, it applies as a hearty, clean, deep rose with a hint of ruddiness / brown; it is very neutral-toned with no discernible pink or peach. It gives my complexion a healthy looking rosiness -- I really like it a lot, and I was pleasantly surprised.


While I would buy it again, it is unlikely that I will ever need to do so -- a little goes a very long way, and I get more than the full effect from just a touch of my stippling brush. I think it would work really well on all skin tones and intensities -- it's a very neutral color. Lovely!

"With the NARS Orgasm Blush, I heard so many great reviews in magazines and from friends that when I went to go and buy it for myself I was still feeling a little skeptical. After actually testing it and deciding that it didn't seem all that bad, I went ahead and bought it on a whim, thinking that the store lighting wasn't helping me make up my mind and that I needed to really try it out for myself.

I ended up going home, putting it on and saw in the mirror that my face was reflecting light! 
After a careful inspection I saw that the blush actually contains little flecks of gold, which is something I don't expect to find in my blush. I still shunned it though and went out for the day hoping that I didn't blind someone with my reflective cheeks. Later when I went to go touch up my makeup, I saw that my cheeks looked so blotchy and that the gold flecks had just made my face appear like I had just come from the circus!

The thing about this blush is that even though it is quite a versatile and flattering colour, the gold flecks in it might not suit some people. The texture of the blush itself it very nice aswell, which is what I expect from a company like NARS, but in the long run it might not suit combination or oily skin in hot/humid weather.

"I wanted this blush soo bad.  I dreamed of having this blush from a far for months before I actually got my hands on it and my heart broke when the day finally I came that I brushed this blush across my cheeks.

"For my very first blush I wanted something natural a few months ago. Checking the reviews here I wanted to try Orgasm but it seemed TOO pink for my taste.  I settled with Deep Throat, which is a sheer pink with some suttle golden shimmer and I LOVE it to this day.  Luster does exactly what I was looking for back then but the color in the pan is so deceiving that I probably never tried it.  Luster looks like a nude beige in the pan but on my NC35 face is a sheer, natural glowy peachy color (with NO pink or orange in it, I dont know how its possible but it is what it is).  You MUST try this on your skin to make sure that's what you want. So dont buy this and expect to look like a made up doll!! Now that I own two of NARS' blushes I can buy Orgasm and have for a while to see it works for me or not.  For my first blush it was too much for me.  I LOVE LUSTER! If ever run out, I will defenitely buy again. Everyone should have a natural blush in their makeup kit.

I have to say the price for the NARS blushes are unbearable. I just ask myself if I'm going to use the product more than the price.

"This is a great product due to its intense pigmentation (one dab is enough for both cheeks), it’s finely milled texture and lasting power. NARS blushes either pretty much work for your or they don't. They are generally better on pink toned complexions so me not being one of these, this is the only colour that works for me. I would say this is a grown up version of MAC's pink swoon. On NC25 skin, it looks dusty peach and darker than what you think it would, hence a very light hand is needed. While it’s true that only a small amount is required, these are also significantly less in quantity than others (20% less than the typical 6g) so these are not cheap. This is a matte finish without being flat. I find the matte finish blushes in this line to be a lot more flattering than the shimmer ones. Also there are so many cheaper dupes out there for the shimmery ones, but this colour I would say is unique and I have not been able to find a cheaper alternative.",0.9354838709677418,1.0,this is a great product due to it intense pigmentation one dab is enough for both cheek it s finely milled texture and lasting power nars blush either pretty much work for your or they do not they are generally better on pink plexions so me not being one of these this is the only colour that work for me i would say this is a grown up version of mac pink swoon on skin it look dusty peach and darker than what you think it would hence a very light hand is needed while it s true that only a small amount is required these are also significantly le in quantity than others le than the typical so these are not cheap this is a matte finish without being flat i find the matte finish blush in this line to be a lot more flattering than the shimmer one also there are so many cheaper dupe out there for the shimmery one but this colour i would say is unique and i have not been able to find a cheaper alternative,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.9324813845844236,0.5410897435897435,0.1975982532751091,0.18168130489335,0.2622950819672131,0.3708599585062242,0.4756031187864695,great product due intense pigmentation one dab enough cheek finely milled texture lasting power either pretty much work generally better pink plexions one work would say grown version mac pink swoon skin look dusty peach darker think would hence light hand needed true small amount required also significantly le quantity others le typical cheap matte finish without flat find matte finish line lot flattering shimmer one also many cheaper dupe shimmery one would say unique able find cheaper alternative,1
"This is probably the most over-hyped product in existance. After reading time and time again how amazing this blush is, I decided to buy it. The packaging is great, it's small and sleek and great for popping in your handbag on a night out. It is very pigmented and I don't need to use a lot of it to show up on my NC25 skin. The pan doesn't hold a lot of product however, and if used everyday I could imagine that you could hit the pan within about 6 months - a lot different to my mac blush which is still going strong after 1 and a half years for the same price.
Despite using different primers and creme-bases for this product to stay on all day, the colour disappears after about 2 hours leaving the glitter residue all over my face. I love wearing glitter but the size of the chunks in this are pretty crazy - if you're looking for a subtle shimmer then this is not the product for you. The glitter also settles into pores and makes them appear larger than they are - not great as you can imagine. That being said however, if you use this blush at the tops of your cheekbones and apply a different colour to the apples then you can easily get around that. For £17 I really would not have to resort to that though!

"I must admit, I have not gravitated towards blushes for a long time. More recently I've been obsessed with red lipsticks and anything Tom Ford. I digress. I saw Shameless Fripperies post a photo of Luster on her Instagram and being the puppet that I am, I go to my nearest Mecca to try it on. At first sight, I thought ""that's it? What is so special?"" But once I had it on my cheeks I was in love. It is best described as an apricot colour. Definitely leans more orange than pink which is a nice change for me. There is definitely shimmer but it's not obnoxious like its sister, Orgasm or Super Orgasm (or whatever it's called).

"I like this blush... which I think is a peachy pink but it's pretty much pink on my skin. Orgasm had all the hype and when I checked it out, it was just too glittery for me. So the assistant had recommended Deep Throat and put it on me. I bought this last year from Mecca Cosmetica (clearly overpriced seeing as all makeup in Australia is), so honestly, I wouldn't mind spending $27 on this blush if I had decided to buy it in the US. 

The packaging is pretty good and comes with a mirror, which I like (except I don't tend to use it because I don't have the need to fix up my blush when I'm out). The only thing I don't like is that it attracts a lot of the particles and so it ends up looking pretty dirty after a lot of use. I've never dropped the blush, so I don't know if it shatters easily.

"I am Asian, yellow olive combo skin, NC 30-35. I used to buy and use this blush for years (I also used to buy NARS multiple stick - a cream stick that also was light and sparkly that has probably been discontinued long ago). Oddly I used it when I spent more time in the sun and my complexion was darker. when it was on the skin, fade was a bit uneven resulting in the glitter becoming a bit more noticeable. But, back then I didn't wear primer etc etc. I just brushed on some color and that was it.  I eventually stopped using it when I decided that I didn't want my cheeks to be sparkly and that a light pink peach (not as much pigment or staying power  as other NARS colors)  was not really my shade. There are a number of good dupes out there for those who do not want to spend for NARS. If I did brush it on today, I might use it as a highlighter sparingly applied over a bit of bronzer.

"I think maybe I got a bad pot. I do love this color. And this is exactly the kind of peachy-pink shade I am always drawn to whenever I go to any make-up counters. Every time I go to Sephora, I swatch this on the back of my hand and it just looks so pretty. But buying one and bringing it home and using it on my face proved to be disappointing. I absolutely adore Nars blushes and I have about 7-8 of them. I know the quality & pigmentation are outstanding. But for some reason, this just does not show up on my NC42 skin tone! I have to apply it over and over again before I get any color pay-off on my cheeks. Once I do, it looks nice and works well as a natural, daytime blush. It warms up my face and seems like the perfect ""beach"" color. Something that looks so natural that I could wear this to the beach. Again, considering I have loved all of my other Nars blushes, I think there is just something off about the particular pot I have since it doesn't seem as pigmented.

"I am a huge makeup junkie, but I can never bring myself to buy really pricey makeup. I've always wanted NARS products, which of course is one of the priciest brands of makeup. So when I got a Sephora gift card for my birthday I knew what brand I would get. Nars.

I decided to research what product I would get the most use out of. I ruled out Orgasm just because I had tried it before and it seemed overhyped. The blushes from Nars are always talked about so I went into that arena. I looked through all the blushes and one stole my heart. Luster.

I had seen raving reviews about Luster online. It was described as a peachy-gold. Ideal for olive-medium skin tones, I fell in love with the idea of Luster. So with my Sephora gift card in hand I rushed to my mall.

Now that I've had Luster for a few months now, I'm glad to say I'm very glad that Luster was the first product I purchase from Nars. Luster gives a GORGEOUS golden peach glow to your cheeks that is completely dupeless. The texture is great, its pigmented and a little goes a long way.

"I used to really love this blush but now it's not as amazing as I thought. I love the shimmer but I always felt like I have to build and build this until it showed and that's because I'm fair skinned. Also, it seemed to have faded.

It is easy to see why this is a cult fave.  It is absolutely beautiful and looks more natural than anything I have ever tried.  Makes you look healthy.  The perfect balance between pink and peach. The shimmer is very slight - just gives you a glow, not a shine.  The new formula seems more ""loose"" than the old formula according to former reviewers - it doesn't take any building up to get color. A little goes a LONG way.  I gave it 4 stars for packaging because I would like a little brush included, for touch-ups.  Gave it 4 stars overall because there are several toxic ingredients, among them triclosan and 2 different parabens (look it up on skindeep.org).  Too bad they didn't take out the parabens with the new formula.  For this reason I don't know if I will keep this blush, even though it's absolutely gorgeous.  I also wish the shade name wasn't orgasm - I'm not sure I'd want to tell my mother what my blush shade is called!

"For me, Sex Appeal is the absolute perfect blush that no one can tell it's on (for those who have medium toned skin, I have yellow undertones), but does make a very big difference when applied. If you're searching for a blush that will show up as a true peachy pink, this is not the suitable shade for that job. I personally am really drawn to the fact that its a pinky nude color with a peach tinge to it, it delivers a very perfect nuance to my overall face that I personally love. For me, it's a very subtle (and i mean extremely subtle) wash of color on the cheeks, that's only a little bit lighter than my skin tone.

"I love this blush! 
I have really fair skin, and I was on the hunt for a perfect pink blush last summer. I bought 'Amour', my first Nars blush, and was so surprised! I hardly even have to touch my brush to the product to pick enough up! It is so pigmented, that you really don't even have to 'sweep' your brush across it, just touching it is enough.

"I honestly think this blush is overrated. I purchased it because of all the hype it gets. It's a good blush, but it's nothing special. It swatches beautifully, but it doesn't translate that well to the cheeks, and I've tried with different brushes. Also, I have to dig in my brush more than usual to get the payoff I want, in comparison with my other blushes from Too Faced or The Balm, and I prefer the formula of the last.

"I think this blush is beautiful on my fair skin.  If I use a light hand it adds a pretty warmth to my cheeks, or if I want a more dramatic look, I can build it up.  Normally I dislike blushes with shimmer in them as they tend to accentuate my large pores, but I don't find that this one does.  I do think that if you have any acne on your cheeks, the blush tends to accentuate it.  I usually go over any spots with a dab of concealer though, so it isn't much of an issue for me.

"i am super late on the Orgasm train but i must admit, i was alway more drawn to Deep Thoart because it doesnt have the gold shimmers. I got a generous sample card from Nars and decide why not. This does give me a healhy flush but it isnt the ""in from the cold"" flush, more of a poppy fun coral pink flush. I find this to overpower my eyes and lips so if i do wear this, i got to have very neutral to light makeup on the rest of the face. I am someone who love nude neutral blushes so this one is more outside my comfort zone. I know some say its very natural but to me the gold shimmers along with the poppy pink doesnt mimmick my natural flush at all. I can see this being a wonderful spring summer time blush but i just dont gravitate towards corals on the cheeks. I much prefer Sex Appeal in this range because its lighter, more nude and baby apricot. 

I have tried TheBalm Hot Mama and Mac Peachykeen, i do admit i like Nars the most. If i had to pick id pick Orgasm if i want want gold shimmery coral flush.

"I got supremely lucky and found this blush at TJ Maxx, paired with some NARS lip gloss for $29.  The color looked close to Orgasm (which I've been pining away for), so I snatched it up.  I'm so glad that I did.

I have olive skin, and this color looks great on me.  The shimmery-ness is subtle and natural-looking, and it truly makes you look like you're glowing.  It also doesn't settle into my fine smile lines like some of my other blushes.

I do believe that I've found my HG blush.  Although I love my Pixi blush, this one has replaced it due to the natural, glowing look it gives.  It looks great any time of day and I don't have to use a lot of it to get the look I want.  Yes, the price is high, but worth it, IMHO.  How can you put a price on a natural-looking, youthful glow?

"This blush seems to be everyones HG item. It is a nice blush to have, with my medium skin tone it is pretty flattering, but i don't know about the universally flattering thing it has going on. If you're into pink blushes then go ahead and give this one a try. Its a good blush, the colour pay off is good and it lasts long, however that being said it really isn't that special. There are multiple dupes for this blush, and you could easily find something that looks similar. If you're a high end blush hoarder like me, then its a nice blush to add to your stash. However if I hadn't purchased this and say tried it off of a friend, I would not go out and buy it, because at the end of the day it really isn't anything special. The sparkles/glitter in it are really subtle, however you can see a little bit on the cheeks. If you're going for a natural look, or have acne/problem areas on your cheek I would not recommend this, as it brings out imperfections.

"I would give this more of a 4.5 than a 5 but nevermind. The reason it loses half a point for me is because it is quite expensive and i think for the price you are paying, you should at least get a little brush on the side.

As for the product, i find it beautiful. I am NC25-27 with asian yellow undertones and have no problem with it showing up on my skin like some people have complained.


It looks peach in the pan but applies more pink on my skin, probably because of my yellow colouring. This isn't a problem though as the natural flush in my cheeks is actually pinker/redder than that of the blush, so if i apply carefully, it looks fairly natural rather than clown's cheeks.

And i find the glitter/shimmer quite subtle, it wakes up my face. i wore this blush on a night out and it lasted all night! Usually, powder products do not last long at all on me so i was pleasantly surprised.

I tried it with many different brushes, it still gives me a beautiful result. There is enough shimmer to create a natural glow on your face. With this product, a little goes along the way.

"<b>Dolce Vita</b> blush was released with the <b>NARS</b> fall collection back in 2008. It's a warm dusty rose. It is not shimmery which makes it a very natural looking blush color.
<br></br>It is super pigmented. So be careful when applying (especially if you are, like me, a fair blonde), you only need a very small amount to achieve that healthy just-got-in-from-the-cold look. I recommend using a skunk brush when applying. Since I have to be careful when I apply it this is not a blush I apply when I'm in a hurry. The first time I used it I applied too much which is a mistake I will not make again. Seriously this is the most pigmented blush I've ever come across. Keep that in mind when applying.
<br></br>When carefully applied this blush is just gorgeous on the cheeks. I'd definitely repurchase! Though I don't think I won't have to since a little product goes a very long way. I think this blush will last me a lifetime considering how little you have to use each time.

"I try this blush every now and then again, hoping that this time it would reveal its amazingness to me. Yes, all the hype that surrounds it gets to me and makes me curious to discover what is it all about. In a way, I want to like it.

But every time I am shocked and turned off again by all the glitter. I see nothing fresh on my face, just this glittery balls my cheekbones turn into. Other then that, it is rather transparent on my skin- the hint of apricot is too subtle for my complexion and does nothing in particular. I tried the light hand, the heavy hand, the professional hand. Always to the same results: the same face, not lit up, not refreshed, just very, very shiny on temples and cheeks. 

I am a big fan of Nars makeup, especially blushes, so I suppose the quality is equally high with this one. The packaging is handy and beautiful and all Nars blushes are really long lasting.

"Sin is a plummy raspberry color, to me. You definitely need to use a light hand or apply it with a stippling brush because this blush is very pigmented!

"I LOVE Nars blushes, and have loved everyone I've used, but this one was just a little too dark for me. I don't always have a bunch of time in the morning to worry about how lightly I'm applying my blush, I just go for it. Well, I couldn't do that with this, I'm an NW20, so I'm pretty fair & the color was just a little too dark on me. Now, if I have time to use bronzer & apply this lightly and blend, etc. than it's great and looks amazing on me, but I had to only give it 4 lippies, cause it just wasn't the whole package for me (quick app. for day & layer for night).

"My first real makeup splurge! :p 
Purchased Orgasm almost two years ago and since I’ve also got: Luster, DT and Torrid. 
Torrid is actually what I was hopping Orgasm would be like because torrid is more pigmented however I still love and use Orgasm quite often. 
I use a fiber optic brush to apply it and usually I apply it on top of a bronzer, that way I get an amazing peachy glow. I would have preferred it to have a bit less glitter but it still looks great on me and I’ve had it for years and still you can barely tell that it was used! Can be considered a tad expensive however it last forever so it ends up a great value.

"I do not know how I overlooked this blush in my many NARS counter trips--or, for that matter, how I lived without it.  

It started for me at Sephora, when I saw a darling teenage girl walking away from the MA with something beautiful on her cheeks.  I ran up to the MA, ""excuse me, what did you put on her face?!!!?""  Turns out it was Luster, and I have never looked back.

Colorwise, it's a glowy medium peach with a slightly bronzerish quality to it.  I'm pretty fair, and I can't tolerate a lot of brown without looking muddy or just weird.  This is just the right mix of peach and bronze with a shimmer SO fine that you can't really see it, only its effects.  I am VERY sensitive to glitter b/c of my emerging wrinkles, but this passes the test easily.  Like all NARS blushes, this is well pigmented and will probably last me years.

This blush makes me look and feel radiant, alive, and just pretty.  It's an amazing look for every day.  I especially love wearing it with warmer shadows such as peaches, bronzes, and golds.  I also like to pair it with MAC Honeyflower and Instant Gold, or really any warm lippie with Instant Gold Lustreglass over it.

The NARS blushes are a bit expensive for my taste/budget, and they have that ridiculous packaging that everything sticks to, and you can't clean.  But will I repurchase?  Absolutely.  Worth every penny, this is my new HG blush!

"This blush confuses me. The color in the pan is so shockingly bright, I was almost afraid to use it. However...on my cheeks it almost doesn't show up, it wears more like a sparkly highlighter. I have fair skin, and I own dozens upon dozens of blushes, mostly drugstore, and I almost never have a problem with my blush being pigmented enough. For example, I own Milani Luminoso which people compare this to...and I can't wear it without feeling like a clown because it shows up as bright orange on me, and nothing I do can tone it down. Am I expecting to much? Is the point of this blush supposed to be that it's so subtle you are not in fact wearing blush...but truly just have a natural flush from having an orgasm??? Do people sparkle and sweat out glitter after an orgasm?! I don't know what I'm doing wrong...but I'm going to keep experimenting with different brushes to try and get better color payoff. Im not crazy about the size of the pan either, makes it difficult to dig in with some of my larger blush brushes.

"This is the blush that got me into blushes! This is such a beautiful shade, its soft and glowy on anyone! It doesn't add too much color, but it keeps the face from looking dead. If you are into super bright loud blushes, this isn't for you. If you want a natural flush, that gives a touch of glowiness, this is for you!

"I was really hesitant at first for buying this blush. I looked up swatches and reviews online and found that it was going to be too light on me. I went to sephora and actually tried it on my cheeks and love it!! The color is soooo gorgeous. I am asian and I have some yellow undertones to my skin. My skin is neither pale or dark and I have an olive complexion. It's a peachy pink color with the perfect amount of gold shimmers. You only see them when you come really close to the mirror. The shimmers are not that noticeable but the overall effect gives a pretty glow to the cheeks especially in sunlight. At first when you apply, it can look really pink but then after a while it turns a bit more peachy and it sinks into your skin giving you a natural flush. If you have large pores on your cheeks, it could emphasize them because of the shimmers. The case does get dirty fast but it's really compact and beautiful with a mirror.

"Why don't I like this??? Arghh.......Seriously, I really really really wanted to love this blush.  It looks like such a pretty pinkish peach in the pan with subtle shimmer....yet on me it looks like i have pink matte blah cheeks. To be honest, I was quite happy using The Multiple in Portofino, but of course I had to own one of the famous NARS blushes.  Let's just say that at least for me, Deep Throat is overrated.  I've tried a variety of techniques, varied the amount of product used, and applied with different brushes, but nothing is working out for me.  It looks okay, but for $25 and all the hype, I feel like it should do something for me.  Oh well, I won't hold it against the blush, I guess, but on my medium skintone this wears as sheer and simply too pink.
One thing I love about this is the packaging.  The compact is so sleek, and has such a neat rubbery feel.  Don't you just love how NARS creeps along in bold white lettering in striking contrast to the pitch black case?  Not to mention the fabulous mirror inside. *sigh* I think I've convinced myself to try to make this work for me....again.  Maybe I'll try pairing it with something else, maybe there's hope......

It may sound strange, but I like to put on my NARS Portofino Multiple, then Deep Throat, then Portofino on top.

"This is just one of those products which is absolutely not made for everyone ... and that's what makes it fantastic.

If you aren't paler than MAC NC/W 15 or so, this probably won't do anything for you. If you either a.) only like pigmented blushes or b.) need/want more than a whisper of color on your cheeks, or c.) definitely never want to have to have to dip your brush more than once, Sex Appeal will be a big disappointment. On the other hand, if these factors do describe you - good for you! like 90% of the blushes in the world are more or less aimed at pleasing you. 
<br><br>
Like most people who will really love Sex Appeal, I am very pale, and have a lot of red in my cheeks that I don't really want to play up. NARS Sheer Glow in Siberia is my current foundation of choice, and it does a great job of knocking back the red in my cheeks. Such a good job, in fact, that I am much more inclined to play around with blush - something which I once feared. But even the old me who was scared of blush still would have loved Sex Appeal. It's absolutely fool proof. If I take out most or all of the red in my cheeks, Sex Appeal can restore that perfect level of barely discernible but natural healthy pink.  If I am just wearing tinted moisturizer or a very light foundation and the red of my cheeks is merely toned down, Sex Appeal adds a bit of focus and shape.

This behaves well with most brushes, but I like my Medium Pointed Yachio from Hakuhodo the best. But then again ... it's my favorite blush brush in general, so that shouldn't be a surprise. Still, the precision of a smaller brush is excellent in this case, and the aforementioned brush is excellent for blending. You can layer on quite a bit of Sex Appeal without it looking cake-y, thick, or anything less than perfectly natural (at least on someone with my skin-tone. I imagine it would look very chalky on darker skin-tones.)

Sex Appeal is just so ... easy. This is the blush I reach for when I don't feel like *thinking* about it. Blush can be a minefield for someone like me, and this one always guarantees a good result.

Without primer, however, it fades really quickly. Overall, I do reccomend it, though. You'll use it forever before having to replace it.

"I wanted to love this after hearing all the rave reviews from practically every beauty magazine on the planet. The color is beautiful but there is SO much sparkle in this it makes my pores look huge and rather disco-ball like.

Too sparkly and not worth the money IMO.

"The NARS original orgasm blush is an iconic product that most makeup junkies own or have owned. I am a fan of the original blush although it's not my favorite. I was excited to try the newer Super Orgasm blush...I don't like it...at...all.  There's too much glitter. This would be great in a Toddler's and Tiara's pageant although you wouldn't want to paint your child up in a blush titled super orgasm. That would be in poor taste and those pageants are all about keeping it classy. The color is ok, it's a pinky peach shade with giant chunks of GLITTER. It looks like someone smacked you in the face with a bag of glitter. This is not flattering and to pay $30 for a blush that looks like you're working the afternoon shift at some hobunk strip club out by an airport is not good. This is just bad.

"This is my first plum/berry toned blush and I love it. The pigment is truly extraordinary as for all NARS blushes. The texture typical of other NARS blushes, tightly pressed but highly pigmented.  Buffed in, most of the tiny gold micro glitters fall out and you are left with a very subtle warm berry blush.  It is surprisingly wearable on my warm asian skin as long as I don't go swipe happy. I apply this particular shade more on the hollows and blend into the centre.  This makes it double as blusher and contour. Fabulous! I can imagine this shade working extremely well for fall/winter m/u looks. I like the rubbery packaging and esp like the mirror inside.  I find the price very reasonable given the crazy good quality of the product and the fact you need so little for each application.  I would def. repurchase when I run out and encourage those who are curious to give it a shot.

Of course I've heard about this blush, hasn't everyone? Nars is one of those companies that I have a love hate relationship with but I don't own much because of their crazy prices. I have one lipstick and I hate it but .. okay anyway.

I was in Sephora and they were featuring the limited edition orgasm blush and I swatched it on my arm and almost had.. well.. an orgasm.

in love. absolutely in love, I didn't stop thinking about it. I left without buying it because I couldn't justify the price, but it took everything in me to walk away from it.

Soooo... two days later I gave in and bought it online. I almost cried at how excited I was to finally get it. And when I used it, IT DOESNT SHOW UP ON MY FACE.

I don't understand. it looks beautiful on my arm, so I think I'm just gonna start covering myself in it. I don't know if I'm being too gentle or what, but it's not doing much. I find myself reaching for my $8 colourpop blush instead. 

I'm obsessed with the limited edition packaging, and all nars packaging for that matter. I know most people can't stand it but I'm a sucker for how sleek and sophisticated it looks.

"I bought this blush in May because I have heard so many good reviews on Youtube. I used it a few times but it is a bit too peachy gold on me and at the end of the day, it tends to disappear totally on my cheek. Last month, I bought Dior shimmer brick in pink. The Dior shimmer brick is a highlighter but the SA told me it can be used as a blush. But the Dior one is too sheer to show on my cheek. When I use Dior shimmer brick and Nars Orgasm together, I have found the perfect blush. It becomes a shade of peachy pink with subtle silver shimmer and it actually brightens my face with a lovely glow. Update: Recently, I spent more time blending the Orgasm blush. If I blend it long and evenly enough, it becomes a beautiful peach pink color without all the gold flakes. I even stopped using Dior shimmer brick on top of it because the blush itself is very natural and pretty. I guess I didn't use it correctly for a long time. Blending is the key but sometimes I'm just impatient.

"Oy, where to start!  I am NW20, black/brown hair, brown eyes.  The color is nice a corally pink.  But it was still a bit ""ruddy"" on my fair - medium skin.  You could ""see"" the blush no matter how much I blended.  You have to be careful with the application; it goes on a bit strong.  Temptalia lists this as a dupe for MAC Fleur Power, but FP works sooooo much better on my NW20 skin.  FP is more pink, where as Amour is more corally/peach.  But the difference makes a huge impact on how I can wear the blush.

Now the part that really sucks.  NARS blush...right, my first NARS blush...I was soooo excited.  But, it completely irritated my skin!  Who gets irritated by NARS blush...I have never heard of this?!?  But as soon as I put it on and walk away from the mirror, my cheeks felt warm & a bit stingy.  Not awful, but my cheeks were getting warmer and warmer.  And it wasn't just once.  It happened every time.  This is the only new item I added.

"I have fair skin with both cool and warm undertones...I can wear silver as well as light and rose gold (but not deep 24k gold so much).

This color looks wonderfully natural on me, it's so flattering! I had purchased Orgasm before this one, but exchanged it because Orgasm has too much shimmer for my taste (though the color overall still looked nice on me). I don't want people to know right off the bat that I'm wearing blush. Deep Throat gives me exactly what I want...a gorgeous, natural looking glow.

This one seems to go on a bit more sheer in comparison to Orgasm (or perhaps I subconsciously learned to apply with a lighter hand), but I don't mind this at all. This compact will last me a VERY long time (thus justifying the price tag), and I will definitely repurchase unless I find a cheaper dupe that has the same staying power.

"Torrid is my favorite blush. For years, i have been searching for a perfect blush that will make my cheeks look different from all other blushes out there. I am NC30 and have pinkish to almost reddish cheeks. I love the fact that sometimes i dont need to use a blush but of course as a makeup lover, i would like to see myself in different cheek colors. With all the blushes i have tried (i am looking at you MAC), most of them has the same effect on my cheeks. Just plain pink!!!

So, when i discovered Torrid, i was really happy with it. I dont like corals but after learning here in mua that Torrid is coral, WOW, i guess i like coral now. LOL!

Torrid seems to be the only peach blush that shows up on me. Yes, it is peachy blush on me with gold shimmers. The blush is very pigmented and i only need a little amount of this to achieve my desired look. One Nars blush will last you a lifetime.

The compact is nice. Although some ladies here said that the rubber packaging annoys them. But for me, it is very nice because it is sleek and easy to place in my makeup bag or in my wallet when all i need is a peachy glow. I also noticed that with all other makeup products that i have used, NARS has the best mirror!!! Yes, i compared it to Chanel, LM, GA, BB, i prefer Nars mirror for a quickie touch ups.

"After pondering this for about a year, I decided to just try it.  I was curious because on one hand, people rave about it.  On the other, a lot of people say it's overrated and give it bad reviews.  But I decided since Sephora has such an awesome return policy, I'd give it a go and if it didn't work out, no biggie.  Well, for me, it works!  It really lightens up my face.  It's lovely and subtle and creates a great glow.  I don't find the sparkle to be too much and the color showed up on me well (not too much color, not too little...perfect amount of peachy pink glow.) It's a little pricey for a blush, but I think it'll last a long time, and it's the best peachy glow I've found thus far.  And as with all NARS packaging, I love the case.  I say give it a try and see how it works for you! The worst that'll happen is you'll have to take another trip to Sephora to exchange or return.  (Oh, for the record...I tried and HATED the Orgasm Multiple first. The blush is the way to go.)

"This is a very easy blush to fall in love with.

I guess to start I will say that I am light skinned, a nc15-20, with medium brown hair/eyes.  I have a slight olive undertone, but mostly just yellow, and fair. -- so for reference that is my complexion/undertone.

Now back to deep throat.  This isn't my *favorite* blush in my collection, but it is my favorite every day blush.  And honestly, if all my blushes disappeared tomorrow, this would probably have to be the first one I replace.

This shade is just so natural, beautiful, easy wearable.  And it doesn't conflict with any other makeup, or wardrobe, it is very not distracting.

Deep throat is of course, the slightly lesser known cousin of Orgasm.  I had bought Orgasm a couple of years ago, and couldn't wait to get rid of it.  I really disliked this blush.  Orgasm is a light pink with gold glitter that is supposed to be *universally flattering*-- HOLY CRAP the GLITTER!  I didn't find Orgasm to be particularly flattering, like it didn't look bad, but it definitely wasn't doing me any service-- it was just some generic pinkish color-- with an absurd amount of gold glitter to cover up the otherwise rather lackluster shade.  I felt like this was a really ""kiddie-ish"" color.  

That was the end of my affair with Nars. Then like literally a month ago I just so happened to swatch this in Sephora out of curiosity, and I am very happy I decided to give them another shot.  

First off, even though it does have shimmer, deep throat isn't nearly as glittery.  In fact, on the cheeks I hardly pick up any shimmer at all.  This is great because I honestly prefer my blushes to be matte.  

Orgasm is described as being a peachy pink with shimmer, and deep throat is described as a peach with shimmer---  I actually think that deep throat is more pink on the skin than Orgasm--  I guess because of all the gold glitter, orgasm looks a bit warmer on the skin.  

Deep throat is a definite balance between peach and pink though. And I think anyone could pull off this shade.  The blush is very much buildable, but I don't know if anyone darker than medium complexion would be able to enjoy this blush, because it is pretty sheer on the skin.  I am very light, so I actually prefer the sheerness because I don't have to apply to carefully, or spend much time blending out the color.  I actually think I could probably apply this without a mirror at all, and still walk out of the house looking fine.

This is the main factor that makes this blush my favorite *every day* blush.  It always looks so natural and healthy.  

I actually love this blush so much, that I bought amour two weeks after I bought deep throat, and I am thinking of picking up yet another.  I can see why Nars blushes are held in such high regards.  They are so much more pigmented than Mac, and have such a superior texture to Tarte, also the color selection is amazing and for the *most part* Nars blushes are pretty flattering to almost every complexion.

I am slowly falling in love with this brand, and am so happy I decided to give them another shot and try deep throat.

"I have mixed feelings on this blush. Yes, I do like it a lot, and it is a very nice color, I just don't find myself reaching for it daily. I find it to be a little too noticeably glittery/sparkly for my everyday tastes, though it looks great for a nice out. I am NC20-25, and on my skin it looks very flushed coral-pink with a hint of peach, and of course gold glitter. This product definitely requires a light hand, unless clown is the look you're going for. I think even on deeper skintones this would apply very pigmented - I think I would actually like it more on those skintones! I could see it providing a very excited, happy flush, instead of the very stark contrast it does on mine (although I must say it looks fabulous with a good tan).

However, it is still very generous in product like other NARS blushes, and the packaging is great.

"Luster - described as ""sheer golden apricot"" - was the first NARS blush i bought. I have since purchased both stronger colors as well as highlighters by NARS. Luster is the color i wear most often of all of them, because it is light and it is not pink. 
.
Nearly all NARS blushes are quite pigmented and they are buildable, so one does not have to go ""full bore"" with them from the start. Use a fluffy brush, don't get too much product on it, and and don't grind it into your skin if you want a lighter color. That way you can see the true beauty of these blushes, which give a lot of color with less product and a light hand. And, of course, if you prefer more color, another application can take it to the intensity you want.
.
I have very fair (between MAC 15 & 20), neutral toned skin and if i just fluffed blush all over my cheeks i'd look clownish. So i use a very light hand with any blush. I actually use a fluffy angled *eye shadow* brush (sephora Classic Angled Shadow Brush #20). This gives me control so i can apply it along my cheek bones, and not on the apples of my cheeks, that way i don't get too much color all over. Once i have blush where i want it, i buff with a clean face brush to blend the edges. Then i add a bit of highlighter on the top of my cheek bones near my outer eye, and sometimes a bit of matte face powder in a shade or two deeper than my skin tone in the hollows of my cheeks for contour.

"Very good blush.
Pigmentation is phenomenal.
It's a great classic pink.
Unfortunately, I am not a fan of shimmer on my face.

Seriously, meh. I understand how this blush became so popular, the peachy undertone is very flattering for lighter skin tones.

"I absolutely adore this blush. Nars blushes are sublime & Orgasm is no exception. It is the most gorgeous, pinky coral shade with glimmer. Everytime I wear it, my face looks younger, fresher, more radiant. I love how it gives a lovely flush of color without being OTT - it somehow always manages to look soft & natural. Some say it's too glittery but I honestly think that is what adds to the radiance. To me, it is more of a shimmer as the glitter particles are super fine. One gripe I have is that it doesnt last a whole day (it starts to wear off after 4 hours) - staying power could be improved. Price-wise, it is expensive (especially here in Australia), but it really does last forever, so I actually think it's worth it. For reference, I'm NC25 with combination skin.

"This is my first but definitely not my last NARS blush. I love the color, it is kind of a goldy peach. The undertones are more orange than pink/red.

Anyways, I bought this, tho I was reluctant after seeing the price. It's pricey and they don't give you a whole bunch. The color is perfect tho. Very peachy/pink with flecks of shimmer. Very pretty during summer and gives you a wonderful healthy glow. Use sparingly tho, because if you apply too much then you look like a clown. Another complaint is the name! It's very embarressing when someone asks, ""what color are you wearing?"" and you have to mutter, ""orgasm""! Plus not so sure the names are great for teen girls. All in all despite the funky name and price, it's a great color and product!

"This product was MADE for someone with my coloring!! I've never felt that way about a blush before, where I put it on and it just *clicks* that this blush makes me look incredible.

I do, however, prefer to wear it on top of foundation as it can bring out redness in my face. Overall, very unique blush, and if you are similar to my coloring I definitely recommend!

"This is probably the most versatile blush I own. It is THE perfect pinkish peach blush with just a hint of shimmer. (so much better than MACs MSFs and Mineralized blushes)
I also have this is the dual compact with Laguna. I've had it for nearly 19 months and I havent so much as put a dip in it.
For ref. my skin is a NW15 or MUFE HD 110 in winter and in the summer months I'm usually quite tan and switch to NW25 or MUFE F&B 2. 
I love to sweep this on the apples of my cheeks for a quick natural look or for an evening out I'll spend a bit more time and combined it with its partner Laguna.
I've gotten many compliments on the look this gives by people who would otherwise not even notice MU.
DH has continually commented on how healthy and happy my face looks and for that reason alone, I will continue to buy this should I ever run out.

" I'm a pretty big fan of this blush! It is fabulous to use in wintertime as it perks up my skin greatly when I am looking particularly pale and washed out. It is a fairly highly pigmented so it is best to use sparingly - otherwise you may end up looking like a clown! It looks a little intimidating at first glance but the color is not quite as deep pink and vibrant looking once applied - more of a pretty, rosy pink and much more subtle than it initially appears.  It does have a bit of shimmer to it but nothing overwhelming, in my opinion.  It has great staying power - lasts all day on my cheeks. The packaging is great.

Ladies, if your compact /gloss is covered in crap it means your make up bag is DIRTY, ok? I have gotten some of the powder on the compact and it wiped off very easily for me. Yes, some sparkles stick to it but if you do not like glitter then you should not be wearing orgasm blush! This line is pretty damn expensive but once you put on the products it all seems worth it. The powder is very smooth and silky to the touch. I lightly pass my brush on it and a perfect amount of product is on the bristles. The first swipe is an instant GLOW. Beautiful golden shimmers dance upon my skin and a very light touch of pink emerges. At second swipe the blush is perfected, deepening the pink into a flattering pigment for my light skin tone. The laguna bronzer is fabulous as well! A very light, mocha type color with a hint of shimmer in it that applies smoothly like a dream. I usually detest using a bronzer because it makes me look 'muddy' but this light brown color is perfect for contouring. My cheeks look so high and sculpted with this amazing set!

"I don't understand how a blush that looks bright orange red in the pan can give me the most gorgeous flushed cheeks ever but it does.  Exhibit A is my Orgasm.  It's simply gorgeous and I didn't even have to use any of my duo fiber brushes or special blending techniques.  I just dabbled an old blush brush in the pan to pick up the tiniest bit of color and popped it on my cheeks.  A little blending and voila--I had a beautiful flush.  Exhibit A is a flat color without any shimmer or specks of glitter but, as with all Nars blushes, it goes on silky smooth.  Nars blushes are not powdery or chalky in the least.  


Exhibit A must be a magical blush.  Orgasm made me look like a cheap hooker.  I don't know if it's the pink or peach but it was simply too bright for me and looked very tacky.  Exhibit A, on the other hand, gives me a perfect blush.  Maybe the warm tones of the orange and red counteract the natural pinkness in my skin?

"Okay - love it.
plain and simple - I put it on, and I look better... 
I glow and I shimmer.

"Bought this product in a small compact featuring Laguna Bronzer (amazing) for christmas. All the hype is well deserved. I absolutely love the color.

"This is one of the few blushes I've ever repurchased. It's a great every day glowy blush. However, each time I've bought this, the product has been slightly different (e.g. size of shimmer particles, how much product is carried on to the brush). The blush is a pinky coral; sometimes it looks more pink and sometimes more coral, depending on lighting. It has very fine warm shimmer. 

Milani Luminoso is a good dupe, but I think this is one of the few products I get sentimental about, triggering the repurchases. I don't like Nars' packaging, I find it hard to keep clean but it travels well.  

On me, this blush is equal parts pink and coral with a light shimmer, creating an almost highlighted effect. It's versatile; working with lots of different looks.

"This is my all-time holy grail blush. I love this type of blush color--my other favorite blushes are all similar: peachy/pink, with a hint of subtle tan. VERY natural looking. 

what I like about this blush is that 
#1 it is very soft and smooth when applied, it never looks powdery, it blends beautifully. 
-#2 it looks like your skin, but better: there is shimmer in the pan but on the cheeks it doesn't appear 
-#3 it lasts the longest of any of my other blushes!!

I have light-medium skin tone, with warm undertones. I am nc 25-35 depending on the season, and i wear this blush all year round. Since buying it, i have almost used it up in the past 8 months, and that says a lot because i do use it all over my face: as a blush on cheeks, and to give a subtle look instead of bronzer around my hairline and jaw.

"What a lovely shade of peachy pink this is! I think it complements my skin tone very well (medium with yellow undertone).
This is great for day wear- just a LIGHT dusting on apples of the cheeks will do, as I discovered on my first try the color is VERY vibrant and pigmented.. 

Adding another layer to make the color appear more is good for night wear.

I think this blush gives a good, smooth finish. This blush has barely a shimmer/sparkle which I like. I first thought of getting NARS orgasm but the gold sparkles threw me off.

"Ditto Winter100's review that this appears cool bright pink with hint of lavender, but blends into a beautiful natural pink.

From the pics online - and the appearance under the fluorescents at sephora - I'd never have chosen this, but I have been looking for a cool-toned pink blush for about a decade and decided to try it out.

I use a light hand and apply it with a synthetic fan brush. It blends into a subdued natural flush of pink which mimics my own skin color when blushing. 

It's not the most unique color and I've bought similar blushes with these undertones. However, I ended up tossing all of them eventually as they just sat on my cheeks and looking powdery, fake, and doll-like. This is the first pink blush I've found that doesn't do that.

"deep throat is part of my holy trinity of nars blushes - orgasm, crazed and deep throat. when i reach for a blush, 95% of the time, its one of these three.


deep throat is a lovely peachy pink, leaning more towards peach than pink on me, with a warm wash of shimmer. deep throat always makes me look healthy, like i spent time in the sun, with a good application of sunscreen so i didn't get too much color. it also adds some depth and contour to my face without looking like i painted a brown stripe under my cheekbone. i am not sure how deep throat manages to do this (i am guessing its the shimmer) but i love that it does!   


there are alot of peachy-pink blushes out there very similar to deep throat. but for some reason, they look like i applied blush. deep throat doesn't look like applied blush; it looks like a color that might occur naturally on my face. <3 


for reference, i am the palest of the pale. i have difficulty finding foundations to match my palor. i am also very neutral, having no real yellow, pink or olive undertones. i apply deep throat with a light hand and tone it down some using it with a highlighting powder.

"HOLY CRAP. I cannot believe it took me this long to buy this blush! I've been hearing about it on MUA for forever, but I always forgot to take a look at it in Sephora. (my closest Sephora is an hour away, so I don't go very often.) 

Anyway, I went into the sephora in the Lynnhaven Mall in Virginia Beach last week while I was on vacation, and I saw the NARS counter. After swatching this blush, I fell in love. 

It's the perfect blush for me. This blush gives my cheeks a glow no other blush can achieve. 

My mom has a blush that is almost identical to Orgasm, called Shy Blush from Mary Kay. The only difference I can detect is that it has a bit more gold undertones, but not as much golden shimmer. (wierd, I know, you'd think it would have more gold shimmer!)

"It's a lot of money for a blush, but somehow I feel like it's worth it. It's highly pigmented - a little goes a LONG way. I'm very fair and I have to apply this very lightly with a skunk brush and then blend well. I've been using it daily for a couple of months now and you can hardly tell any is missing from the pan. It gives a nice glow to your cheeks, very fresh and natural looking as long as you aren't too heavy handed with it. It looks great when paired with the Laguna bronzer. I personally don't think that the shimmer is even noticeable as ""glitter"" on the skin unless you apply a ton of the stuff, which you shouldn't be doing anyway.

"For reference my skin tone is NW25.  I am not a heavy blush wearer or heavy mu wearer in general, and prefer something with a more natural look when it comes to blush especially.  This product, although it has some glittery/shimmery finish to it, makes it appear that you simply have a natural, healthy glow.  Because it is such a sheer finish, using a very light hand during application is not something I found necessary.  I apply this product with a ""traditional"" full blush brush, and the results are great.  The price is pretty high, $26 USD, but because the product is so highly pigmented, it should last quite a while.  Many people have complained about the rubber outer coating of the packaging getting dirty very easily, which is absolutely true.

"Sin may be my favorite NARS blush ever. I'm a very warm-toned NC20, dark brown hair and hazel eyes. Sin just wakes up my face with that just-in-from-the-cold glow, but not windburned looking, if you know what I mean. It's not as pigmented as other NARS blushes, but still pretty pigmented as blushes go in general. The color has been described well below, but if I were to take a stab at it: A dusky plum with very fine gold shimmer. The shimmer is barely noticeable on my cheeks. I love it.

"I bought this because of the great reviews and I must say I love it. I even dab this on when I am lazing at home with no makeup on but lip balm. I hate spending this kind of money on a blush but you know, it will last me forever. One light dab with the blush brush picks up almost enough colour for two cheeks. The colour looks like a beautiful burnt red. If I am going for an 'out of the cold' flushed look, this blush does the trick. It looks natural and like it's part of my skin in any kind of lighting unlike any of my other powder blushes. This is what I think I'm starting to like about these Nars Blushes (I loved this one so much I had to pick up another in the colour deep throat). Staying power is great and is actually better than my Mac powder blushes... but similar to my Mac cream blush (In colour Posey.. which I also adore).

"Really wanted to love this blush as so many others seem to, but alas I was disappointed.  Ended up giving it away as although the base colour is gorgeous, the gold shimmer in it eventually put me off.  It's just too much for a day time blush, especially on a more mature woman.  While I like a bit of shimmer,  this colour ended up looking too orangey-gold on me.  I'm fair with yellow tones, green eyes and blonde hair.

"About a year ago I joined the herd and bought this color, if only out of curiosity.  I was underwhelmed for a long while, especially considering all the carrying on that accompanies NARS Orgasm.  But then I started to notice it was the cheek color that I went to the most.  It is almost a no-brainer color for me (I am on the light medium spectrum of skin tones) because it works beautifully with any color of eyeshador or lipstick I use.  Because my lip colors can range from plums to neutrals to reddish-browns, this is a real plus.  It is a very natural color on my skin, not especially sparkly (that is fine with me) and is seemingly a long-lasting blush, much moreso than other pressed blushes I have used in the past.  So Orgasm won me over and I can't imagine not having it in my makeup kit.

"Angelika looked so pretty in the pan with its refreshing pink color and sparkles. It was unlike any other color I had seen in a blush. Most of the colors from other brands do not look as vibrant or unique as NARS, which was what attracted me to the display at Sephora. When I saw the Angelika color, I had to have it. As soon as I got home, I immediately opened the box and put it on with a light hand using the EcoTools blush brush that I love.

As all of the negative reviews here stated, this color did not look the same when I put it on my face and I was really disappointed because I really wanted to love it. I have medium-tan skin and when I put it on, it turned out red! I tried putting this on with my fingers and also tried putting it on with less blush on the brush but either way, my cheeks were red. The blush brought out all the flaws on my skin and I have a fairy clear complexion. The only way I could get very minimal powder on my face without it turning red was to use a fan brush. However, the color was too light and it still did not show up as the same color in the pan. I ended up returning it to Sephora.

Honestly, in my experience with blushes, the Wet 'n' Wild Silk Finish blushes are the same in quality and high pigmentation as the NARS blushes, except that the color selection isn't as extensive. For example, the Wet 'n' Wild Translucent Pink is quite similar to Orgasm and Heather Silk is quite similar to Mata Hari. They only cost US$2.77 for one! I would recommend trying the Wet 'n' Wild blushes if you plan on buying those colors in the NARS blushes. 

EDIT - I later asked an SA about why this turned up red on my skin. She said that the pink mixed with the yellow undertones of my skin made this appear red on my cheeks, which is why those with fair skin types didn't experience this problem. They were able to get true-to-color pigment of the Angelika on their skin. However, I would advise yellow and olive skin types to avoid this unless you like red blushes. So, word of advice, when you are buying blush you should think about how the color will look mixed with the undertones of your skin color because it will likely not appear the same way that it looks in the pan.

"I recommend that you get this applied to your cheeks before you buy it just because of its cult status. Why? You may be surprised to learn that this is actually a sheer blush, so you need to use more product than you'd think.

"This is my 69th review on MUA and in honour of that very important mile stone, I chose to review Nars ORGASM blush...(hee hee!)
I'm actually quite surprised that I haven't already reviewed this product because it was the very first thing that I ran out and bought due to peer pressure...uh, I mean advice.... from this site.
This really is a great colour for my pale cool toned cheeks. It adds a lovely peachy pink hue and brightens up my face.
I do think that it is quite frosty and there's a little too much gold in it for an everyday staple, but on special occasions this blush does add a dash of POW to my look.
This acted as my gateway product into a deeper addiction to the NARS brand. I have found blushes that I like much better than Orgasm from NARS (Mata Hari, and Madly) but if it hadn't been for the amazing blendability, pigmentation and superiour packaging of this product I may never have branched out...

"This is such an amazing blush. It has earned the hype received. This is a pinky peach blush with a golden sheen. For ref I'm NC45 and this looks beautiful on my cheeks. A lot of ppl say that it is shimmery and the color is sheer, not the case for me. The pigment shows through on my skin with minimal effort and the golden sheen is just that, not glittery.

There are other blushes that are cited as dupes but based on my collection not even the closest blushes compare in overall quality. 
-TheBalm ""Hot Mama"" is not very pigmented and has more of a golden sheen than the peach pigment. Better as a highlight on my skin tone.
-ELF Blush Bronzer duo has very little pigment and is more glittery. When the colour is built up, the skin looks ashy.
-Mally Beauty has a similar blush in their ""Shimmer, Shape and Glow"" ""Love is Deeper "" face palette. The blush very sheer and is a very heavy golden sheen to it. The formula is very dry too.
-Jordana ""Coral Sandy Beach"" is a very good dupe but it is more of a true peach as oppose to a pink based peach as ""Orgasm"". 
-NYX ""Summer Peach"" is the best dupe that I have. The colour is similar but the glitter is more chunky and the staying power is not as good as ""Orgasm"".

IMO ""Orgasm"" is great on my skin because it dresses up my cheeks if I look drab. Also when I want to do a minimal look but want to look fresh, this is my go to blush. This blush really transforms my face when I put it on and the best of all, I always feel great when I wear it. It is such an original shade and formula I'm glad to have it.

"Price: 5 Lippies.
I bet most people probably think this is decently priced. However I'm not a blush fanatic, & thus I'd rather splurge on other items. Why pay $25 when I can purchase a dupe for $7?

Packaging Quality: 4 Lippies
Nothing gorgeous but it is fully functional. Sleek & classy plus it comes with a mirror inside.

Overall Rating: 3 Lippies.
First of all there is nothing unique about this blush. Its a cool toned medium pink with huge glitter chunks. Everything else about this blush is just mediocre. Nothing horrible...yet nothing impressive. I found a dupe called Afterglow made by Ulta. They sell that for $7. 

Would you buy this product again: No.

"I received Orgasm in a swap. I LOVE NARS blushes and own several but surprising i didn't have Orgasm mostly because i have Deep Throat and never felt the need to buy it. And after receiving it in a swap, i still think i wouldn't buy it. My first blush and once HG blush was Urban Decay's Afterglow blush in Score(now discontinued) which i think is a good dupe for Orgasm. But that doesn't mean I don't like Orgasm. It gives me a nice healthy glow and i think it's a great every day blush. it's very hard to overdo this blush. but i don't think it's for everybody. And by that i mean, if you don't like shimmer STAY AWAY from this blush(and obviously, stay away from Super Orgasm). Orgasm is also pretty sheer. I think it's sheerer than Deep Throat. I'm a NC25 and one application of Deep Throat gives me enough color for the day whereas I need to apply Orgasm twice. And i feel like Orgasm fades faster during the day compared to Deep Throat. Although Orgasm is darker than Deep Throat in the pan, I think Deep Throat is more pigmented with less shimmer.

"I found my ""warm"" HG blush.

I was very, very skeptical of this (as others have said, super-scary ORANGE in the case). But, the glowing reviews swayed me.

Oh, man. Thanks to every gal who raved about this. 

I am an NC44 Latina. My coloring tends toward the yellowish/golden. I used to stay away from orangish ANYTHING--lipstick, blush, sticking with cool to neutral tones--especially reds and berries that skew cooler.

Well, duh. I feel stupid for waiting this logn to try this. It really makes me look healthy. I have bad skin--dermatitis flare-ups, acne (and yeah, all my post-puberty life, and I'm 48), scaly dry bits, discolorations. But once I put on a good coat of moisturizer (Kinerase) and foundation and powder, this blush gives me a glowy sort of warm heightened color. A nice flush.

I thought Mata Hari might be my HG, but that one makes me look like I have rosacea, oddly enough.

But this clownish color makes my cheeks look lively and fresh and brightens my middle-aged skin. It's just gorgeous.

I apply it with MAC 187 (skunk brush) and add layers, little by little, so as to avoid the ""clown"" effect. I can layer a lot, due to my darker coloring. On the superplus side: It doesn't break me out badly with a reaction the way some blushes tend to. And it's matte. (I don't do well with shimmers at my age and with my troubled skin.)

So, go ahead. If you fit the profile (see all the glowing reviews), it might be a blush that makes your day. It really makes ME happy!!!!

I'd give it 10 lippies if I could.

"I agree that Orgasm is a very pretty color, and I definitely enjoy it, but I'm not sure it's really worth all the hype.

"I am very fair, usually a 01-02 in all brands (look at my profile pictures for reference) and this blush look very good on me.


1.) I am super pale and yet is does not look harsh on me, no matter how much I apply!


2.) Even though it is a warm shade, I can still wear it with my cool undertones (It is cooler than Orgasm)


3.) It does not have as much sparkle as Orgasm, which usually goes better with lighter skin tones


I would recommend darker/warmer skin tones to try out Orgasm as well,  but recommend all pale/medium complexions to get Depp Throat! The blushes are on the expensive side, but they are also very pigmented and last a long time. (about a year, worn everyday)


Orgasm = A mix of pink and peach, with bold golden shimmer and warm undertones.


Deep throat = Like Orgasm, yet the intensity is turned down a notch and the gold shimmer is a lot softer and less ""yellow"" in my opinion. 


My final verdict:

If you are lucky enough to have a medium-dark complexion Orgasm is for you, otherwise get Deep throat <3

"I've been resistant to reviewing this because I'm not big on cult followings.  I initially thought this was an overpriced and overpraised blush.  However, I bought the NARS Guy Bourdain palette a couple years ago and noticed that Orgasm was a great color on me.  It looks natural, but still gives me a flushed glow unlike a lot of other blushes which either look completely wrong color wise or don't go on smoothly or don't stay on my cheeks.  I finally broke down and bought a complete Orgasm blush to go in my gym bag so I can use this nearly every day.  I've tried the dupes (especially Milani Luminoso) and they're just not the same color or formula.  On the plus side, you get a lot of product for the price and I imagine this will last me some time.

"Holy schmoly, this blush is awesome.  I've been in search for the perfect blush forever.  I'll find something I like and then it either gets discontinued or it stops working as well on me as I (and my skin) get older.  For years, my go-to blush was Clinique New Clover, but I'd often find that it was a little pale.  Yes, it's buildable, but I'd find that I have to use quit a bit of it to reach the desired plummy shade.  I'm very fair and never looked like a clown w/ the Clinique, it's just not that pigmented.  However, this NARS blush is the opposite.  It's heavily pigmented and it only takes a small amount on the blush (think pressing the blush to the compact) to give me the desired color.  Plus, I love the hint of gold, I think it really warms up my face.  Yes, it's expensive at $25, but I really think it's worth it.

"I wanted to love this blush. Everyone seems to love it!
But on my skin (MAC NW20 or Chanel B20 vitalumiere aqua) the colour doesn't seem to show up and instead I end up with a stack of gold shimmer. Not much colour, just shimmer. People have commented at how sparkly I look when I wear it. 

I've tried different application methods, different brushes, light hand, heavy hand and nothing makes this look good on me!

I tried wearing it for a week to see if it grew on me and it didn't. I also ended up with quite a few black heads or areas of congestion across my cheeks where I was wearing it. I've never had an issue with black heads on my cheeks before.

"I LOVE this blush! I was thinking about buying Orgasm as my first NARS blush, but I'm so glad the SA at Sephora suggested Deep Throat for me. It gives me a perfect flush every single time that I've always coveted that you see on movie stars. Plus, the color is very pigmented so I don't use a whole lot, which makes it worth the money, in my opinion. Yes, the packaging does get dirty easily, but I think of it as an easy way to distinguish which blushes are in which package before opening it! Will definitely repurchase again whenever I do run out. I was surprised I loved this blush as much as I did, since my first two tries with NARS products weren't too favorable (cream eyeshadow and concealer)

"Same for all NARS Blush, I'd doubt if I could finish it in my lifetime... considering that I have quite a few of them. But if somehow this turns bad, i guess I'll repurchase.

The bright pink color in the pan has a purplish undertone, and it goes very well with my yellow/olive-undertone fair to medium Asian skin tone. The color looks very, very natural on me and it brightens up my complexion and makes me look fairer and fresh. Don't be scared off by the glitters you see, it's definitely not as dense on your cheeks than in the pan. if you're really mindful about the silver glitters, just tap the brush before applying it and that would solve the problem.. the glitters will fall off your cheeks after 1 or 2 hours anyways. 

However I prefer shimmery blush (natural ones such nars luster/deep throat but not the over the top shimmers like Orgasm) because it serves as cheek highlighters for me as well. But since the release of NARS albatross.. I put it on almost every blush I use, except the already very shimmery one.. it's really an amazing highlighter go check it out!! instant beautification!

"This is my first Nars product, of course it's the blush! I went to Sephora to try on their blushes and wasn't even going to look at the Super Orgasm. It was a last minute try on and it was a tie with another.. (torrid or taos?).

Just recently I was thinking of returning it because sometimes it seems it brings out the red of my cheeks than give a nice glow. But then I realized I must not be putting on my foundation enough to give it an even canvas. So I tried it again and am slapping myself for even thinking of returning it.

It gives a nice spring fresh look. There are a lot of glitter chunks in it but that doesn't bother me. I think that's what gives it that nice ""fresh look"". I can't wait to try it in the spring time. It goes on very nicely and for me it is not super pigmented.

"I love this blush.  There, I said it.  I'm a blush-hater and I love Exhibit A.

My skin is a yellowy-pink-toned NC20ish, NC30ish in the summer.  This blush should not work on me.  And yet, it does.  I use a duofiber brush--which is the absolute key to this blush--and buff it out, and bam.  I get gorgeous, natural flush for my complexion.  I can even use a bit on my eye to brighten up my eye look, if I want to add some color to a neutral look.

The color definitely leans a yellowy-orange red.  Tomato is very accurate.  If you're cool-toned or very pale, this will be way too intense on your skin.  But if your skin is fairly light but warm, you should absolutely give this blush a try.  It's gorgeous!

"This review is coming from someone that is NOT a fan of wearing Blush. I simply don't wear it everyday. I have to be in the right state of mind & on a rare day, to reach for blush. With that said, Orgasm is pretty in tone but too sparkly for my tastes. I have one cream blush from Pout in my arsenal and I figured I should get a powder blush too, just for that rainy day I may feel like wearing it. Orgasm is a dressy blush to me. I can't see myself wearing this during the day as it just looks like it would be best suited for soft, dim lighting. It has a warm peachiness and shimmery luminescence. I prefer a more matte finish. Bobbi Brown's Soft Pink blush is more my taste. However this brightens my face up, which is the absolute #1 positive about this. A lot of blushes tend to make my skin look duller and overdone. This certainly didn't do that. I love NARS packaging, chic and cool.

"Looks different in the pan than it does on my skin. It looks glittery, very pink-blue based in the pan, but more shimmery and peach on my skin. With that said, I like this blush.

"I love NARS Amour, but some days I am really tired looking or my skin is looking super clear and I want nothing more than a Flush.Amour does that, yes,  but I have to use a heavy hand sometimes and it looks really dry, 
I have MANY types of blush: Gel, cream, sheertone powder, highly pigged, you name it I have it. If it goes on your cheeks I own it.
I walked into Sephora to buy this *highly* intimating blush. I almost didn't because the lass who put it on me used a rather heavy hand. The associate also, being young, applies makeup in a way that does not suit a mid 30's woman. She powdered to tone it down, and I bought it. I am an innocent when it comes to eyeshadow, eyeliners and even foundation. Blush, I know how to use. 
So, when I got it home I applied it MY way. Tap the brush in the pan, then swirl it gently on the inside of my wrist THEN apply to my cheeks. Blend well with my kabuki.
What I saw was a lovely, orangey flush that compliments my skin nicely. 
I'll assume the sales associate wasn't very smart, she said I had a "" very fair"" complexion. Ha ha yeah..no. I'm olive skinned. I can't believe she couldn't see that herself, considering her own complexion was blue it was so white.
I'll let you know how this wears in one week.
***UPDATE*** I returned this blush two weeks ago. While I loved the color, I started to develop a rash. I was hoping I wouldn't because there is an ingredient in it called ""carmine"" which is crushed Cochineal beetle. I am *very* allergic to cochineal.

"This is a perfect ""go-to"" blush for me. It looks super natural and pretty on almost any makeup look. I am not a very big fan of blushes, but I have really grown to like this. 

I bought it at Sephora in Copenhagen, and I remember it was rather pricey.  I decided to test it since I earlier saw so many great swatches and reviews. I am not familiar with the Nars brand (Except from all the makeup-gurus on YouTube rambling about it.) because we do not have it in Norway, but this blush really sets the standard. I became impressed from the first sweep, and I've been a fan ever since.

It has a very discreet amount of shimmers in it. I would call it ""warm-toned-shimmers"" if that makes sense.

"NARS website describs the colour as “golden apricot”, and they’re absolutelyly right. It’s perfect for my NW25 skintone. 

I was collecting NARS blush, and this was one of those that I was delaying in getting as I was judging it from the pan. I eventually bought it, and I’ve been wearing it most of the summer. It gives me “the glow from within” that I always wanted. 

On me, it leans a little pink and looks nothing like the pan. If you are planning to buy it, I recommend that you try it in person instead of looking online. 

Just like any NARS blush, this one lasts about eight hours, but doesn’t fade patchy like some NARS blushes, and I love that.

"The strangest thing happenned with this blush. 
For referance my skin is light, with neutral undertones (neither NC or NW, 15 too pale, 20 too dark) but very, very pale. 
I bought this blush about 1.5 years ago because of its HG status, it was fine, soft, pigmented, nice rose/coral tone, very fine golden shimmer, didn´t made me break out, but somehow I just felt it blah. I reach for my mac blushes (rosy outlook, melba and pinch me are my favs) a lot more. 

The blush that I kept in my purse disappeared and I put this one mainly because its mirror (nice packaging, only hate how it forms a crust of dirt on the black surface, have to clean it with soap often) so I started using it more. In matter of days it shattered and I mend it with 72% isopropilic alcohol. Now the blush is more pink, a little bit more dark and fushia and I love it! It suits me better, comes more soft and I can even apply it with a tissue (forget the brush in another purse and was already at work). 

I will probably buy it again, I wanna check the oasis and other shades, and if again I'm not completely satisfied I will add the alcohol again. Very natural for everyday, MBBB with a little bit of shimmer.

"Absolutely LOVE this.  I had Orgasm and swapped it out for something I needed as I could live without it.  I tried to love Orgasm but just couldn't.  So back to drawing board it was to find my HG blush. I had to go out and experiment with other blush colors (drugstore, Sephora, Ulta brands).  I finally found the perfect light pink with a touch of peach among one of the Sephora blushes (can't think of the name atm).  So off I was to find a dupe of it among higher end brands bc they just have better lasting power and as a busy woman, I rarely carry make up along for touch ups.  I tried a few MAC ones, Smashbox, Lancome and Shiseido but they were just too drying for me.  Finally, NARS it was.  I just didn't want NARS as Orgasm didn't impress me that much.  Needless to say, Deep Throat did not disappoint at all.  It is so silky smooth with the right brush and blends easily.  Of course, it's pigmented but I'm not as scared to put a little more of this on versus any of the other colors by NARS.  I also own Angelika and Luster (which were both discounted so I couldn't pass it up) and several other brands as I've mentioned but I find myself reaching for Deep Throat the most!

"I live in Singapore, so didn't have the chance to swatch this in-store since we don't have a NARS outlet here. So I did my ""research"" endlessly to make sure I buy NARS makeup that I'd actually like and use- I mean, for that price, I'd better! 

My package finally arrived, my wonderful treasure chest consisting of Deep Throat, Torrid, and Orgasm blushes, and the Multiples in Portofino, Maui and Orgasm.

I giggled with glee as I ooh-ed and ahh-ed over the packaging and colours in the pan, and the first thing I reached for to swatch was, of course, the celebrated, much-loved Orgasm blusher. 

It looked AMAZING in the pan, the perfect coral-y peach that would end my hunt for the perfect blush, with an ever-so-slight shimmer that will bring a glow to my cheeks, and make me look like I had just had one of it's namesakes!

I dragged my finger across the pan, bearing in mind the reviews that all raved about the Orgasm's sheer amount of pigmentation, and swatched it on my wrist.

Eh? Doesn't look like anything came out- all I can see is some gold shimmer. I guess I didn't pick up enough of the blush! I swiped my finger on the pan 3 times from side to side, and again swatched it on my wrist.

Peach? Pink? All I see is something Ke$ha probably uses to bathe her face in. 

I thought, well, maybe the skin on my wrist is too yellow for the colour to show up. (I dunno!) I grabbed my trusty MAC 187, swirled it in the blush, tapped off the excess and stippled it gently onto my cheeks.

Oh, god. Gold. Glitter. Everywhere. I buffed and buffed and buffed with my MAC 182 to no avail, hoping that the bigger flecks of glitter might drop off. Nope. 

I honestly have no idea how on earth NARS came up with the name for this blusher. Apparently when women orgasm, the glitter monster comes along and pukes a load of gold glitter all over their cheeks?

Maybe it's just my personal preference, because I've seen truckloads of other NC25s that rave about the NARS Orgasm, but it doesn't work for me.

" I like this blush. It provides the perfect combination of peach and pink, however, there are huge chunks of gold glitter in it! I don't find the glitter necessary. A shimmery blush is nice, yes, but I don't see why anyone from any age group would want chunks of gold glitter on her face. After application I usually only end up with a few chunks of glitter on my face that I can easily dust off, so it's not a big issue. I think the regular nars orgasm is pretty much the same thing, minus the glitter. I like this blush, sure, but I wouldn't repurchase due to the big price tag and unnecessary glitter.

"For some reason, it looked *really* great on me in the store using the tester, but at home using the actual product, much less peachy-pink is showing up on my cheek and more gold shimmer.  It almost doesn't seem like the same product that was in the tester!  (And I've read online reviews and watched online YouTube reviews that say the same thing, to see if I was imagining it!)  

Some people think this might be because of all the oil from people on the testers, but I do not think so.  I use a cotton ball to clean off the surface of the tester first, and then use a fresh cotton ball to test.

"I told the Sephora s/r that I was looking for a pink blush to make my very, slight, olive-toned skin (sallow in winter) healthy, but that I didn't want something ""out there"" or ""a pop of color,""  just something natural and understated.  I have tried Orgasm and found it too peachy and glittery, it just looked fake.  The s/r suggested Benefit Dandelion, but I had tried that and didn't seem overly impressed.  We then agreed on Madly, which I had read would work well w/my skintone.  In the pan, it looks orangey/brown w/some pink, very unusual.  When I lightly applied it, I got the worst muddy streak.  I rubbed it off.  The next day, I tried it again, applying lightly and building up.  Horrible, this color definitely clashes w/my golden undertones, but most of all, this is not a ""healthy pink"" color.

"I am a nars blush lover but i cant get this to work.  I want to compare this to mac warm soul because they are very similar. Warm soul is more coral pink beige and madly is more tan orange beige. Madly is blendable if you powder first after foundation. it can be patchy if you dont set the foundation or just go straight on bare face. Mac warm soul is a lot more blendable on bare skin. If you like the pinkier look this wont give that to ya. There is no pink in this blush. It can actually be a bronzer on my skintone.  

Reasons i dont like this and wont be repurchasing

Can be finicky and need a very light hand
Too orange/Unnatural on my skintone if too much product applied
Patchy and muddy on bareskin

I cant get this to work but i know why a lot of people rave about this. If you have a slight tan with olive undertones this can look great but for me it just doesnt work on my skin. It pulls very orange and unnatural so i only can use the tiniest bit but that doesnt blend well on bareskin. I dont use powder on the face so this i need to have a tan to use and i dont tan well. Lol very pasty asian skin. 

Edit. I tried this with different brushes and i found the nars yachiyo works the best. I dab it into the product then into my hand to get some excess off.

"This was my first NARS blush purchase. At first, I was hesitant to buy it because of the price--I hadn't spent this much on a single blush before--but after hearing such good things about it, I gave in. I'm so glad I did because this is my absolute favorite blush--not just from NARS (as I've since purchased others from them), but from any manufacturer. The color is super flattering and lasts all day for me. The blush looks rather sparkly in the pan, but when applied, it's a very subtle shimmer. On me, it appears as a peachy-pink flush.

"I am so shocked to find that I adore ""Madly"" so much more than I do Orgasm and some of the other more prominent Nars blushes. We all know they're fantastic blushes, but I really think this one is more of a hidden gem.

"This is the most beautiful blush I have ever tried, and I have tried a lot of them ;) I originally bought Orgasm, due to the hype, and held high hopes for it, but unfortunately on my NC30 with strong yellow tones, it made me look ghastly, it was just way too coral, almost ruddy looking. So I swapped it way and that was that. I stuck with my MAC Sweet William cream blush, as I really like the natural dewy look. But I was never overly satisfied with it, as while being a pretty colour, it just didn't last on my skin very long, and I have normal, to dry skin in the winter. So I decided to take the plunge and buy NARS in Deep Throat. AND, I LOVE IT!! It is the most beautiful, natural pink flush on me, I look healthy, happy and rested when I wear this, which is exactly what I wanted. NARS are the only powder blushes I have found that are not 'powdery looking' or chalky on the skin, as I detest the matte, powdery look. I apply it with my MAC 187 brush, and it just glides on to my skin, and looks like it is part of my skin, like a glow from within, oh yay :)  I HIGHLY recommend this blush, you will love it. I will always wear it and continue to buy it.

"It's kind of hard to describle this color. It's supposed to be a cross between Sertao and Orgasm. While both colors are pretty in the pan, neither one shows up on me. For reference, I am a GGG NC40. Although I wasn't convinced that it looked good under the lighting at Nordstrom, I purchased it and decided to play with it at home. 


I am so glad that I did!


If you like Lovejoy, you'll definitely like Luster. Although it can be used as a highlighter, it really can be used as a blush. The look is more subtle but it manages to make you look healthy and there's just the right amount of shimmer. Like all NARS powder blushes, the pigmentation is excellent. It didn't streak or turn orange. Luster really is a nice every day color which could be easily built up. Honestly, this is going to give Orgasm a run for its money. I don't really see the peach that everyone speaks of in this blush.


I don't know if this is a permanent part of the collection but if it is, great. If not, get one while you can. I haven't seen it in Sephora but Nordstrom for sure has it!

Secondly, the colour is highly pigmented! To me, a little much since I have really fair skin. So the colour is just too much for me. I try to be gentle and add only a hinty witty bit, and to no avail, it still looks too much on me (clown face). I don't like this product for that sole reason. I know others may find it nice because it's a high pigmented product, but honestly, I think it's just better to build up the colour anyway, so there sure are other brands out there that does a better job and less expensive.

My HG blush is NARS Exhibit A, and this is happily a lot easier to apply than that (make 1 wrong stroke with Exhibit A and you can look like Bozo the clown!). Anyway, this is a gorgeous light peach color in the same fine, beautiful matte consistency as their other matte blushes. I have red hair and peach blush that is too orange makes me look like a weirdo. But peach blush that is too pink just isn't special for me. This is the perfect balance.

Meet Taj Mahal. Gorgeous, gorgeous, GORGEOUS. I *love* orange blushes, and this one just became my absolute favourite. Amazing colour, fantastic texture and the fine, golden glowy shimmer. Apply with a skunk to warm up your complexion with a little orange tint - don't worry, this stuff might be pigmented but it's easy to control with a stippling brush. Alternatively, embrace the overdone clown cheek (it can be done tastefully, I swear) and attack with blush brush of your choice. <br>
<br>
I love it to death. NARS rubber packaging isn't my favourite but if it was more functional and less classy I'd whine about that. It's a fantastic blush, I can't believe I waited so long. If you love orange, BUY IT.<br>

"It gives a really amazing glow on my cheeks and it probably works for a variety of different skin types which is really good!

"The color is beautiful, don't get me wrong. But as I get older, I find I don't like products with so much shimmer/glitter in this. Be warned: this is a very shimmery blush. After having the product in my makeup bag for a few weeks, the mirror part fell off so now I have to separate pieces of the compact which I have to keep separate because if the top falls of in my makeup bag, blush gets everywhere! I am not rough with my makeup but part of the plastic fell off.

The packaging is decent, the color does flatter lots of skin tones and it truly does look beautiful on. The only reason I am not repurchasing is because I feel as though I have found many drugstore blushes that look just as beautiful on my skin tone. I bought mine for $28 from Sephora plus 9.5% sales tax. $28 for a blush? Really? I understand that it is gorgeous but a bit excessive for me, really. Try Santa Rose from Rimmel, it's beautiful for a fraction of the price.

Overall, I am glad I bought it but I will not buy it again. It was great when I last in my late teens but now as I mature, I don't want glitter all over my face.

"I""m disappointed with this product. I gave this away, I couldn't wear it.

Firstly, it is a beautiful pink color on my cheeks. But those gold flecks...! It highlights my pores, makes them look like craters... And this is with primer. The catch 22 is that if I use enough to get the color I desire, it also means there is too much gold flecks. I also kinda look like a disco ball, it's a bit too made up for an everyday, sun kissed look.

It doesn't last more than a few hours, but I find this to be a universal problem anyway due to my oily skin.

There are plenty of other blushes with a similar pink, with less shimmer/gold I would rather use. For $44, I would rather try other products.

The colour is just so pretty. It's a peachy pink with gold shimmer.

"This blush on my skin is a peacy pink with a hint of gold shimmer, just as how it's described off the NARS and Sephora website. The shimmer in this blush is far from being glitter (there is another blush, Super Orgasm  which has glitter). The shimmer is very fine and it does not come off fake or too shimmery when applied to the skin (a very shimmery effect though can be possible if layered). This blush is pigmented that I only need one or two taps/swipes across the pan. I use the MAC 187 brush and I stipple it on the apples of my cheeks and moving upwards to my temples. Once stippled, I use the same brush and do circular motions to soften and blend out the look.

"This is my first blush from NARS and I love it! I wanted a natural looking everyday blush, and while this is a little bit too pink to be undetectable on me it still looks like a nice flush: it just makes me look healthy and awake. I have a slightly warm medium/light skin tone, but I think this would look even prettier on pale complexions. The pigmentation is so intense that I only lightly dab my brush in the pan once for each cheek - if I need more colour I will add a tiny bit more - then I blend in with a kabuki brush. You only need the smallest amount. Perfect for the apples of your cheeks.

Also the lasting power of this blush is insane; I applied my makeup before lunchtime and lightly dabbed this on top, then went to a 10 hour shift bartending, had some drinks myself, and didn't return home until after midnight.

"I really like this blush (my first NARS blush btw). It's quite subtle on my nc44/45 skin (I also use NARS luminous weightless in syracuse and cadiz mixed for winter; cadiz alone in summer). I usually wear bronzer in place of blush but I decided to try this because of a youtuber (Tantricks) with a similar skin tone and I'm glad I did. I don't like over the top makeup for myself and this is perfect for me. I only ever use the MAC blush in Peaches once in a while and I like that but Luster is much more my style; it's a much darker and brownish peachy colour with a slight golden shimmer. The longevity is average for me since my oily skin tends to break down any product as the day goes on. It lasts long enough for me, better with primer. The price is very high for a blush but I've come to a point where I'm not as touchy about price for quality/satisfaction. Even so, that's one star off my overall rating. The packaging is simple and nice, easy to open and it feels smooth to the touch. This has easily become a staple for me.

"NARS Orgasm Blush is really a pretty shade of pink with just the right amount of shimmer - it's a blush and highlight all in one. Although the shade is lovely in the pan, I have trouble applying the blush to my porcelain skin without applying too much. The color doesn't seem to appear after the first few swipes across my cheeks. By the time I can see the color, it's often too bold and seems childish.

"Well I was actually quite pleaseantly surprised by this product. I resisted buying it for a long time because the color just didn't look right for me. I have naturally darker tanned colored skin and so I normally buy deeper richer colors, plums and dark berrys. Peach/coral type blushes just don't show up on skin and aren't flattering to me. As a matter of fact I just got a free sample of benefit's coralista last week and it didn't work for me at all. Completely disappeared on my skin but left a shine. 

Nars Orgasm actually does show up on my skin. I suppose it's because it is so highly pigmented. That was the first surprise, the second surprise was that this color was actually flattering on me. I never chose shades in the peach family because they don't look good on me, but somehow this blush does. It's a soft beautiful pinky/peachy glow that looks almost natural. It's very pretty. I suppose it is a bit more shimmery than i would normally like but I find the shimmer really only shows where the light hits, which for me is at the top of my cheekbones. That's not so bad as I often highlight this area anyways. For right now I would say this is my HG blush. I say for right now because my love for all products seem to end at some point.

I have only tested this on the back of my hand so far as I was already wearing makeup but I am not that impressed already!

The packaging has a nice feel to it but the rubbery-ness makes me think of cheap products. 
I used an angled blush brush for my little hand tester and was quite dissapointed I had to swipe over the pan a few times to even see any colour on my brush. In saying this I has to apply it twice to get a nice level of colour on my hand. 

In shadows it's a nice pinky-peach colour but once I turned my hand into the sun all I could see was orangey-gold sparkles! I am going to try this blush out properly tomorrow but I think it will be too shimmery for me and also it faded off my hand after about half an hour so I'm really not that impressed with my initial testing.

"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers - this is really, REALLY pigmented. So, if you like to really layer your blush on or if you don't have the right kind of brush, you may want to go for something a bit more subtle. Otherwise, something this bright and this pigmented will make you look like a clown.

I use a skunk brush which picks up very little product, and even with that brush I just dab it into the pan a few times (I definitely don't sweep it on).

"I've got the Orgasm/Laguna Bronzer with nail polish set as i wanted to try the Laguna as i've heard rave review on it and as Sephora's F&F event, so i got it at a much cheaper price and i shall say among a few of the Nars blusher i've got, this is the most worth it for the price. I've got two shade to try and secondly, they both suit me well. Nars blush has come to known for their pigmentation and i've often have to use oh so gentle tip on my Mac 188 on other blusher (e.g. taos, desire and oasis) yes i have try enough to know their color payoff but this is the only thing that i don't have to worry if i over apply it when i brush heavier on Orgasm, it does not go on OTT on my face, NC20 here but Laguna i ought to be careful as it can go on too bronze but once i blend, it's beautiful. I think this is better best apply in the morning than at night as seriously with the sun shining on the face, it give a nice glow. :) I've always try other dupes of Nars Orgasm as i think it's abit overhype but now once i try i know why it is so popular. If i ever used up, which i really doubt so since i've really have mountain ful (i know there isn't this word but this is how i think will best describe my blusher collection, i really do hate myself for buying so much so now i have already gotten them much much lesser) i will certainly repurchase this even without any sales at all.

"Orgasm is probably the most popular or well known blush from NARS, and is a beautiful peachy pink color with some shimmer/sparkle. I like that there is a reflective quality in the finish, it makes a person look like they are glowing and healthy. I am NC35, and this color and Deep Throat are great shades for me- where Orgasm is like the lighter version of Deep Throat (these are truly odd names for blushers...). NARS blushes are really pigmented- one pan can last you over a year even if it was the only blush you owned. The product has good staying power as well- I don't notice a lot of fading as I do with some other blushes. 

The packaging is NARS' signature black rectangle packaging- with a mirror included, and a clear plastic insert that I oddly keep in the pan (very snobby of me to keep anything that has a label).

I am suprised this product gets such raves.  Its pretty but its no Orgasm or Sin. Luster is a shimmery soft pale peach with a little golden shimmer. Does not have the pinky hint to it that orgasm does. Also not as much golden shimmer as Orgasm.  Great for a softer look with less color. Works well with my nc30 light olive complexion.

"...Wow! I don't really know where to begin on this product - it's my official HG blush, so I've jumped on the bandwagon, I guess =P

1. The colour is amazing! Although it looks a bit shimmery and scary in the pan (esp. on display at Sephora, yuck), when you put it on, it's just great! It doesn't look like it's sitting on your skin or anything - just a natural, nice flush. Just make sure not to overdo it, or you end up with busy hooker cheeks - not good.

2. One sweep with the blush brush is good for one cheek =D I'm so surprised with the awesome pigmentation! I've been using this more or less every day, and the original imprinting is still there because of how little of the blush I've actually used! Crazyy =)

3. It stays on all day, even if you fall asleep and all that - and thats great, since it looks like a perfect flush.

"I have owned 5 NARS blushes(Luster, Sex Appeal, Oasis, orgasm and Sin*up for swap) and this is the one I reach for the most. I am NC10 for reference. I use Lancome Idole Ultra 24hr in Ivoire 100N and this blush stays well throughout the day. I don't reapply. When I use my powder foundation or revlon PR, I can get 8 hrs before it begins to fade.
The color is a sheer peachy pink with gold shimmer. The shimmer doesn't make me look like a glitter ball and I have received compliments from men who've told me I was 'glowing,' and women who ask me what it is. I bought my first one in 2008 and with an average use of 5 days a week, I just finished it up 4 years later and started on my back up.
I apply this with my ELF studio blush brush for stronger color and ELF studio stippling brush for more subtle color. I found this extremely easy to blend and never cakey/chalky with either application.Color didn't oxidize on me. Sometimes I blend this over Luster with the stippling brush. When I use a stippling brush with this, I notice less shimmer transfer than with the denser brush. This is the perfect afterglow sexy flush. Take that into consideration when plotting your makeup look for the day. Not always appropriate for some looks. Fun to play with though.
I don't get breakouts or eczema flare ups from this and I don't smell any fragrances whatsoever in this.
Though I love the durable matte black mirrored compact, it's a PITA because it's rubberized and picks up everything and you're very limited as to what you can clean the outside with-Don't use alcohol. It doesn't come with a brush which is a plus for me because less bulk in my make up bag.
 $28 bucks is a hefty price tag BUT it lasted me four years...so at $7/year this is a steal depending on how you look at it.

"NARS Orgasm is kind of a tricky blush to do a review on. I love it because it gives such a nice, natural & healthy glow and it works on practically every skin tone (no joke!) but this is only a really good blush if you have really good skin (just my 2 cents on it!) The shimmer in it kind of gets all over your face and when your skin is on breakout mode or if it's just not too good, then the shimmer kind of accentuates the unevenness more and makes it look worse. But when your skin is okay, this could easily be the perfect everyday blush! 

It is expensive but it's worth the money because it's so pigmented so you literally just tap your brush in to get enough color for your cheeks. The packaging, like all NARS products is really sleek and classy in the beginning and it comes with a little mirror of its own, but I don't like how it gets really dirty after a few uses.

I would not repurchase this just because I feel like you can get the same color in a different brand for cheaper minus all the glitter (which can sometimes be annoying). MAC Peachykeen looks really similar to this and it's not so glittery and I like it a whole lot more.

I am SO loving this blush! It is a very versatile peachy pink that has quickly become a staple for me. I love that it is matte because I'm obsessed with shimmery eye makeup and I think that shimmery blush and eyeshadow together is over-the-top. It looks ugly in the pan, but it is amazing on the skin. It's not chalky at all and is nicely pigmented. I only need to dab the brush into the pan a little to get the perfect amount to apply on my cheeks. This blush really lives up to the NARS blush hype and I cannot wait until I get more!

***UPDATE***Though I've now grown to love matte and shimmery blushes, this is still one of my favorite blushes. In fact, it is probably one of THE favorites (I have a lot of blushes so I can't just choose one favorite! hehe).

"After coloring my hair darker, I discovered a lot of my lighter peach/pink blushes either disappeared on me or made me look washed out.

"I bought this blush because i find some more matte blushes to be boring. I hoped this blush would give me that extra dimension of color, because it had sparkles. When I first bought it and applied it at home, i enjoyed the color, but i soon realized that how sparkly it was . What I don't like about this Blush is that I don't find the pigmentation to be very good, as a blush, you have to keep applying it over and over to get enough color to wear as a blush. There is also a lot of glitter, as others have stated in their reviews of this product. Which is not necessarily bad in my opinion, but it makes it hard for me to wear during the day, unless I am doing something non -professional. But besides that, I like the glitter pieces, in this formula, I think they go on the skin a lot smoother, reflect nicely on my skin and look less obvious on my skin then say Mac MSF,, which sometimes  make skin too shinny and especially when i wear during the day. My secret with using this blush is to either apply it before or after my regular blush, to give my other blush a little more dimension and sparkle. I think this product is decent, I think if you end up using it the way I do, then its overpriced, its not necessarily a bad product, but defiantly not a must have product or one for beginners in make up. But if you have extra money to spend, one something to give your other blushes dimension, when your out on the town give this a shot!.

"I was sceptical of the hype and wary of the glitter but must admit I'm hugely impressed. It's shows up like a sheer, natural flush on my skin tone.  Although it looks very sparkly in the pan it isn't obvious on the face, instead providing a soft, subtle glow. Application is very forgiving and the soft texture means my brush picks up a good amount and it blends so easily. It makes me want to try more NARS blushes to see if the formula is this great on the other shades. I actually find myself using the blush more frequently for both night and day looks, even though people might think it's to shimmery for the daytime. It layers nicely over my other blushes too if I want a bit more depth of colour, and completes every makeup look I try with a fresh, flattering glow.

"I love NARS Orgasm Blush!  First of all, I really love the packaging. I like the rubberized compact and the mirror is large enough to actually be useful. The peachy-pink shade is very flattering to my fair skin-tone.  And it has the perfect amount of shimmer, in my opinion.  I think it gives a beautiful, healthy glow. The pigment is fantastic. I only have to use a little bit to get great color; this compact will last me a very long time.

"Another winner from NARS. I've become so obsessed with these I have to have em all! Like pokemon! I like that MH is a little darker than Desire. Desire is WAY too bright for my liking, but I can still wear it for a cute baby doll look. MH is definitely warmer than Desire and really wearable. I would also say that I can make this look just as natural as Exhibit A, although with that color it REALLY looks natural. I really like MH.

"Beautiful blush!! When I first purchased Orgasm I have to say that I was a bit disappointed - the colour didnt really wow me. But after about the 5th application I fell in love. First off, you have to apply the blush in an upwards and outwards motion - not too on the apples. My rule is when applying blush always make sure you leave about a two finger sized gap from your nose. You also have to really blend this blush in but that is quite easy to do - its a creamy powder!! The shimmer is gorgeous and its very natural - I am a NW20 for reference. Great colour. Great quality.

"Out of the three NARS powder blushes that I currently own, this is the softest, most traditional shade in the pan. This goes you an idea of how my taste in blush runs:  I prefer powder blushes that are highly pigmented, bright, and matte (or with very minimal shimmer).  Amour is a lovely soft, pink with a strong dose of peach and a matte finish.  Like all NARS powder blushes, the color pay-off is excellent, and little product is needed (if you are nervous about overdoing it, I would recommend applying with a fan brush like Smashbox #22.) The more I use this shade, the more I appreciate its lasting power and versatility - since it's not exactly a straightforward peach or a ""true"" pink, it works with a wide variety of color palettes.  It lends my warm NC 35 skin a soft, natural glow, and I can imagine it working on a variety of skin tones.

"I was hesitant to buy Taj Mahal for many years, because it is marketed mostly towards women with dark skin. And then I decided to give it a shot. I am NC20 and I really like it.

"If you are what I call ""blush phobic"", but are after a natural looking blush - then look no further.  I have rarely ever worn blush, due to the fact that my cheeks are naturally red/pink already, and I don't want to add any more pink or redness.

Luster however does not have pink in it - it is a very sheer, natural taupe and slight apricot colour, perfect for that slight sheen on your cheeks.  It also works absolutely brilliantly with the Laguna bronzer, or any other bronzer - it complements the colour bronze very well.

"When I first ventured into the world of blushes, I began by reading reviews on Makeupalley (D'uh!) and given that I am a cool toned pale girl (NW15), I concluded, with much help from the boards, that MAC ""Pinch of Peach"" was for me, it's a pinky pink pink colour and only just MEH. it was nice but not very natural or anything special. 
When I found this product and experimented with it, I finally knew what I was looking for in the perfect blush.
The colour of this blush exists somewhere between bright clown wig red, and exotic deep purple. It still surprises me that I ever even looked twice at this blush because in the pan it is a CRAZY kindergarden smelly marker magenta colour. BUT, when applied with my 188 brush lightly to the apples of my cheeks it is actually a natural flush colour.
The packaging is GREAT (I believe that ALL makeup products should include a mirror), and compact and cute. The staying power is remarkable, and there is enough pressed powder in this one pan that I don't ever anticipate needing to buy a new one.

"I've always been a lazy blush-user and am usually not motivated to find new brands when the one I'm using works for me, so for the longest time I'd been using Well-Dressed by MAC. The pan is finally reaching its end and I decided to hunt around for another brand, just for the fun of it. The great reviews of Nars brought me to the counter (which incidentally just opened its first store here in SG) and, well to keep a long story short, I asked for a coral/peachy colour that wouldn't look too stark or shiny on my Asian, fair-cool skin tone (I wanted a slightly more natural colour that still showed) and was recommended Deep Throat. Used it for the second time today and I love it! 


It's so much more pigmented than Well-Dressed and the colour goes on nicely and smoothly. It's very easy to blend into my cheeks. I over-dabbed with my blush brush yesterday and learnt my lesson today, and just two taps with my brush and I've got all the colour I need for my cheeks. The colour is also a very pretty shade of coral that brings out my cheekbones nicely. I love how it looks on me and will definitely buy it again! Only possible downside is that it's pretty pricey for a small pan but it looks like it'll last a very long time given how little I need to last the entire day. I love the packaging - small, nifty and can fit very neatly into my little makeup pouch.

"I bought this product because of all of the great reviews about it in magazines and on MUA. In Australia, the RRP is $72 (wayyy to expensive to buy in store) so I bought it on ebay from the US. 

I have to say that I was both disappointed and suprised: there is so much glitter in it! i dont mind the actual colour (although it doesnt really suit my skin tone), but the glitter was too overwhelming for me. After application, it sank into my pores and didn't look pretty, as well as accentuating every single one of my skin flaws (i have some acne scars and uneven skintone). I have to generally stick to matte blush tones because anything else draws attention to my skin flaws. Needless to say, I will keep it in my makeup kit for jobs, but won't be using it on myself.

"HG! HG! HG! Forescore and seven years ago (which is only mild hyperbole) I received a Clinique GWP. A travel blush and brush tube thinger, shade: Sweetcheeks. It was perfection. But the GWP size was relentlessly huge, and I never had to worry about tracking down an actual retail package until they were nowhere to be found. So I have since rationed Sweetcheeks, and searched the world for a similar pale peachy-terracotta (in the tube) blush which applied like . . . nothing. Just like . . . glow. To no avail. Since Madly appears bronzer-colored in the compact, I'd never have looked twice at it until seeing all the fab reviews that popped up on the main page a while ago. MUA: thank you, thank you, a million times, THANK YOU!!! I immediately ran out and purchased Madly and it is brilliance in a quickly linty little compact! I have fair skin which is itself fairly neutral, but very pink cheeks, so I swing both ways, tonally, and this just looks like a non-muddy, non-tan bronzer glow. Just a great, fresh, healthy, un-made-up look. No visible shimmer, but again, a great glow-y finish. This is my first Nars blush, and I'm pleased with application and blending, though it is *really* dusty when loading my brush.

"I'm so keen to love this blush that I find myself sneaking into the bathroom at night, long after removing my makeup for the day, just to 'try it out again.' I went to Mecca (the only store that sells NARS in Australia) hellbent on finding the perfect NARS blush. Unfortunately I became stuck with a completely disinterested SA, who told me ""any colour"" would suit me.  Argh! I wanted to try a few out, but the lighting was so bad, and the SA so inept at removing and reapplying the various blushes, that I had no idea what was what on my cheeks.  Eventually I chose Sin based on the way it showed up on my wrist.  

I'm VERY fair, and don't know how to work out if I'm cool or warm, but my skin has a lot of colour in it - the skin itself is absolutely paper white, but I sort of always have a lot of blood beneath the surface, giving the pinky-fair effect.  Because of this, my lips are cheeks are quite red and flushed naturally, but only when I'm well-rested and warm.  Most of the time, however, I'm stressed out of my mind at work (I'm a lawyer), running on minimal sleep, and looking tired and wan.  My goal is to mimic my natural, healthy skin colour.

Sin does not seem to be that colour for me.  It is, however, the most beautiful blush I have ever used.  It feels like silk, applies evenly, and has a divine shimmer which is anything but glittery.  The finish is very sophisticated, and I think it's the perfect formula for a work blush.  You can really tell this is a high end blush, it doesn't look at all whorish.  I find that this blush is the only part of my makeup left just as I applied it at the end of the (very long) day.

The colour, however, just isn't quite right for me.  It's very warm, and mauvish, so I think it would look divine on olive skinned girls.  I had the cunning idea of trying it just after a workout, when I was flushed, and that confirmed for me that the colour isn't right - it's much more purple than my own natural blushing colour.

"I bought this two weeks ago and it is my HG blush. I like it because it is not an orangey peach which would not suit my pale (which is on the cooler side) skintone at all. It is not so heavily pigmented that I'm worried I will go overboard with the application and it can be layered easliy. It has a golden shimmer that can be buffed in (which is good because I prefer matte looking blush). For added pop I sometimes wear Torrid on the apples with this underneath on the cheeks and it is very pretty. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone because even though it is expensive (£18.50) it is very long lasting on the skin and the amount product itself would last a long time too.

"HG!!! I own about five blushes that I really like. I never thought orgasm would be good for me because it's always been described as peachy or a bit orange, and I am cool toned. I also don't like GLITTER. HATE it. Looks so tacky. But I love a glowing blush. I'm also pretty pale and thought it would be really obvious on my ppp cool skin tone. So I thought orgasm would suck and never thought about buying it...but then I saw it at the nars counter (looked awfully glittery!) but then the MA tried it on and it looked beautiful! 

I CAN'T wear anything else! I doubt there is a dupe - I have several other glowy peachy pink blushes but this is like the other. It brightens up my skin - it makes me look so pretty!

"I really like this blush. The formula is silky and not powdery at all, which is the problem I have with so many blushes and my biggest pet peeve when it comes to blushes. I love the microshimmer because it gives this subtle glow that doesn't come off at glittery on the cheek. You can really control the amount of color you put on the cheek from very sheer to more opaque. The color itself is a slightly dirty plum color with gold microshimmer. When I say dirty, I don't mean unflattering, I just mean there is a natural brown sort of undertone to it. The only reason I took off one lippie was because depending on how pale I am it does have the tendency to look slightly bruise-like on me, but this is only when I am at my palest.

The colour is perfectly natural looking and gives me a lovely healthy glow, i cannot understand people saying it doesnt show up it gives me a lovely natural glow both in winter with little makeup on when i am relatively pale and when i am nicely tanned or wearing false tan! I do apply more than i would with a more highly pigmented blush such as the Chanel Irelle Blush but this is not a negative point as it is not marketed as a dramatic highly pigmented blush like the Chanel.
I also think the packaging is fantastic, practically indestructable and with the great little mirror for touch ups! 
It is also really long lasting, i bought mine months ago and use it every single day but it still looks brand new!

This is over rated in my opinion. It is a nice medium pink colour with a shimmer but it doesn't make me think 'wow! I look amazing!' which is the effect I would like to have!

"I purchased this blush while on the UK MUA shopping tour and it is my favorite item of all my purchases.  I have been wearing this all week and I know it is good as I have received many compliments at work....

This blush actually sticks out at the NARS counter.  It more looks like a color for decoration and to catch the eyes of customers as opposed to something they a seriously trying to sell.  It is a very bright orange and not for those who are faint of hart.  Honestly I do not think that this blush is one that works for many people. I can see this working for darker skin or olive skin types.   I have a yellow/orange skin undertone (Priscriptives Category) and this may be the reason why this blush works so good for me.  It warms up my complexion and makes my face look more alive.  I can wear this blush with just about any make up look and it never goes wrong.  To give a better picture, my foudation skin tones are:   la Mer Bronze, MAC NC45/C7 or Laura Mercier Toffee Bronze.  

I currently own 4 NARS blushes - Sin, Dolce Vita, Crazed and Taj Mahal but  Taj is now my favorite. Dolce Vita has moved down to No. 2.  NOTE - for those who can muster up the courage to try this blush, it must be used very sparingly.  Go light and build up as needed.  This is not a blush I would purchase online.

"This blush is absolutely incredible. Unlike the cult favourite Orgasm blush, this blush is very smooth and such a nice, fine texture. It is a pretty light colour, so it is hard to over due. I personally like to pack on this blush, but sometimes I do like the natural 1-2 sweeps of this on each cheek and it looks gorgeous. It's a really nice peachy colour with gold in it, and on my skin, it has that very teeny little tinge of pink on it so it doesn't just look, bleh. However, if you are looking for a peach blush, give this one a shot because it is definitely much more of a peach than a pink. There are some shimmers in this too, which I personally like because it's kind of like a highlighter in one. At the same time, I can imagine myself using this in the winter where a bronzer might seem too much for me and I can use this on my cheeks but add a little bit of contour as well, since I'm into lazy people products :). It is pricey especially since it was $36 dollars (tax included) or so in Canada, but I personally think it's very well worth it, because I love it so much. I love NARS packaging even if it gets dirty easily, it's very sleek and kind of makes me feel a little more 'glam' if I take this out in public to use the compact mirror because I find it very handy too!

"I just read the below review, and what, there are bad reviews for this? I absolutely love this blush! I am surprised I hadn't reviewed it yet.

In the past, I'd be pretty inexpensive blushes, but after reading about this color so much, I bought it when I was given a Sephora gift card for a gift. Great purchase and no regrets! The color is gorgeous and warms up my face. It's a warmer colored blush, so it really helps liven up my fair skin and I don't look so pale. When I have a tan, it also looks great. It seems to go well with many skintones. It is like a medium peachy pink color with a hint of shimmer. Very pretty! I notice that a lot of the photos taken and posted here look different. I'd definitely recommend seeing it in person because of how different the shade can look depending on the lighting and camera.

Packing is good is good as well, and although it is pricey, it seems to last a while. Pigmentation is pretty good, so you don't have to use a whole lot of it. I bought  mine about 8 months ago and just recently hit the pan, but still have a good amount of product left. I use it almost every day, but I'll occasionally use a different blush if I want a different shade. 

I will be repurchasing for sure. I am curious to try Mark's Ever Glow blush since it's supposed to be comparable, but less expensive. I may purchase that one to just use as a back-up. I was tempted to buy the Super Orgasm color, but after seeing both in person, I am glad I went with the classic version. The classic version has a hint of shimmer that is natural looking and gives you a nice glow, but the Super version has actual sparkles in it, which was a bit much for me. 

Awesome buy and well worth the money! If you are unsure about it, try going to Sephora or anywhere that sells Nars and try it in person first. I prefer to test out pricey makeup prior to purchasing to make sure I really like it :) This one, I love it!

"First things first: I'm a cheapie-makeup addict. I haul from Dollar Tree and Big Lots more than Sephora; I believe that retail price doesn't always equal quality. That being said, I have never EVER come across a drugstore blush that could hold a candle to NARS blushes. Exhibit A is no exception. It is a fever-flushed red, sexy and bold. I think this color would work on absolutely anyone, given the right application. I'm nc10, and I basically just wave the compact in the general direction of my cheeks to get the right amount of color.

"NARS has turned me into a blush addict! The fantastic quality of this and Orgasm has me wanting all the NARs blushes! I am an NW15 in MAC terms and Mont Blanc in NARS works pretty well and I am neutral to cool-toned. I selected Madly for use as a contour, bronzer shade. I don't know why NARS describes this as a seashell pink, when to me it looks like a slightly bronzed, brownish peachy shade. All right, so maybe not a very good description on my part, but I don't think seashell pink is either! In any case, this is fabulous for me as a contour or bronzer. I usually wear it in the hollows of my cheeks (you know, the ridiculous looking fish-face trick) and swept across the temples and under the chin and man oh man, glowing perfection! (The blush- not me. I would never refer to myself as perfection). I also wore this on my apples recently and I was shocked to see it actually looked great!

"My lust for Nars Orgasm Blush has turned into a loving committed relationship.  This blush is the duct tape of makeup.  It is always flattering and lasts all day.  In the winter when my complexion gets pale and sallow a swipe  chases away the ""blahs"".  Yet it also looks fantastic with a tan.  It's subtle enough for daytime but beautiful for the evening.  

I've tried to copycat this, but Nars is well-worth the money.  It lasts a long time and the texture and pigment just can't be duplicated.  The shade manages to be both understated and bold.  The color is a bit apricot without getting too orange, a bit pink without any blue-undertones, and has the finest bit of gold sparkle.  It all adds up to a warm healthy glow that resembles - well - the afterglow.  

Buy it.  You won't regret it.  

* I took off one point for packaging because the compact gets really dirty.  While the case is aesthetically beautiful, it has a matte finish.  So I have to clean it often; especially if it's in my makeup case with powders, etc.

"I understand all the fuss about this blush, it is very flattering (on the right skin tone) however the reputation of being Universally flattering is not true at all!


I think I was misled by makeupalley reviews because the majority of people making them have medium - dark complexions.


I am very fair, usually a 01-02 in all brands and this blush look awful on me, for several reasons.


1. I am way too pale for the shade and it looks very harsh on me


2. It is not super great on people with cool undertones (me)


3. It has too much sparkle for my taste (however it still depends on your skin tone - it looked Fantastic on my mother who have a darker complexion and yellow undertones)


I would recommend very pale people (and people with pink/cool undertones who does not wear this very well) to get NARS deep throat as:


Orgasm = A mix of pink and peach, with bold golden shimmer and warm undertones.


Deep throat = Like Orgasm, yet the intensity is turned down a notch and the gold shimmer is a lot softer and less ""yellow"" in my opinion.

"I won't repeat what others have said about NARS blush quality - finely milled, heavily pigmented but blendable, and longlasting - and neither will I comment about the silly dust attracting material they use to make an otherwise excellent compact, but I just had to put in my 2 cents about how difficult it is to make this particular shade work for me.


Dolce Vita is a lovely deep cinnamon-rose hue, but not one that I can put on in a rush, because without careful application (light hand, not-so-dense brush, a single tap - I repeat: tap, not swipe this blush is *that* pigmented) I end up looking like I just got a tight slap (two cheeks, so two tight slaps?). It is also matte, not that I have a problem with matte blushes, but in this shade a matte texture makes it look extremely flat. 


Anyway - if done right and blended well, DV is a sophisticated blush, very demure as opposed to just fresh and cheerful. It's just not for every day, and definitely not for when you're in a hurry. And you can't just wear any lipstick with this; Dolce Vita can pull orange in photos - the cinnamon in cinnamon-rose that it is is not obvious IRL but jumps out like a bronzer under a camera.

"This blush is, in a word, pretty. Very, very pretty. One forgets that that's the basic idea behind wearing makeup.

"Someone on MUA said that the measure of how much you like a product is whether you'd go replace it immediately if you lost it - and I think that's dead on!  I did lose my first Orgasm blush on a trip, and I went out and replaced it right away.

I can see where this color wouldn't work on everyone, particularly those with deep skin tones.  It just wouldn't show up.  But on me it's flattering and subtle.  And it's easy to apply because it's pretty sheer (that is, not a whole lot of precision required before I have coffee in the morning).

"Another fantastic blush from NARS! Mata Hari is as described NARScosmetics.com,a ""rose petal pink"". I think that description is pretty accurate. It is the perfect matte pink color, no shimmer or glitter which I prefer. It looks dark in the pan,  However, once applied on my cheeks using my 187 brush, it shows up as a perfect pink. Suprisingly this complemented my NC50 skin very well. This blush like most of NARS blushers  the quality is  excellent. Great pigmentation and great staying power! My blush looks just as good after 6 plus hours of wearing.  NC/NW15-30 skin tones have to be careful with this as it is  very pigmented. With that said, a light careful sweep with a 187/88 brush should do the trick!

Torrid is a Coral with a hint of peachy/pink and less shimmer than other NARS blushes.  Torrid is a high pigmented blush and maybe to bright for real light skinned or strong cool toned people.  I wouldn't say this is an everyday color, it doesn't work on me with certain e/s colors like plums, reds or blues for instance.  I like using Torrid with e/s colors from the green, brown and gold families.  Torrid does look a bit bright on my winter skin, but I really like this when I'm tanned-it gives me a more exotic look!

It may be too subtle at first, but it gradually darkens to a perfect shade as it mixes with the natural oils on the face. It's not as tricky to apply because it's not as pigmented as the other shades.

"Update:
I've completely changed my mind about this blush. NARS Sin has become my go to blush everyday. Why? As I said the colour shows up as darker pink on my face which is actually good because it sorts of contour my cheeks a little. So by using this blush alone, I don't need to use a bronzer/shading powder to achieve a subtle contoured cheek. I put it on my cheek slightly lower than my usual blush but not too low where the hollow part is. I usually pair this blush with NARS Habanera on my eyes and Benefit Benetint on my lips. Voila! I'm good to go.

Sin has one of the most unique colour i've ever seen which is why i bought it in the first place. It has berryish, taupey colour with shimmer on the pan. To be honest, i rarely pick up this blush. It shows up as darker pink on my face. I feel like this blush makes me look more mature. The staying power and pigmentation are great though as any other NARS blushes. http://aboutagirl.onsugar.com/Review-NARS-Blushes-Swatches-11880958",0.7096774193548387,0.6666666666666643,pletely changed my mind about this blush nars sin ha e my go to blush everyday why a i said the colour show up a darker pink on my face which is actually good because it sort of contour my cheek a little so by using this blush alone i do not need to use a bronzer shading powder to achieve a subtle contoured cheek i put it on my cheek slightly lower than my usual blush but not too low where the hollow part is i usually pair this blush with nars habanera on my eye and benefit benetint on my lip voila i am good to go sin ha one of the most unique colour i have ever seen which is why i bought it in the first place it ha berryish taupey colour with shimmer on the pan to be honest i rarely pick up this blush it show up a darker pink on my face i feel like this blush make me look more mature the staying power and pigmentation are great though a any other nars blush,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.9855101630106662,0.4625,0.1975982532751091,0.1718946047678795,0.2285714285714286,0.3135685299295777,0.4837659468123819,pletely changed mind sin ha e go everyday said show darker pink face actually good sort contour cheek little using alone need use bronzer shading powder achieve subtle contoured cheek put cheek slightly lower usual low hollow part usually pair habanera eye benefit benetint lip voila good go sin ha one unique ever seen bought first place ha berryish taupey shimmer pan honest rarely pick show darker pink face feel like make look mature staying power pigmentation great though,3

"When I finally tried Sin, all my purple, reds, vampy and gothy lipsticks stood up and applauded.  Finally a blush that gave them all the proper attention, balance and pop they deserve!  I am NW20, winter with almot black hair, brown eyes, pinkish skin that can make blushes turn ruddy or orange ( I have a weird undertone, but Sin stayed true & didn't turn).  It brought such balance to my look when I popped on my UD Rapture or my Revlon Black Cherry.  It even gave new life to my MAC Up the Amp.  It is my plum lipsticks' new best friend.  Sin is a gorgeous plummy but not heavy on the brown shade.  Others have done great jobs of describing the color here.  I was trying to avoid shimmer, but unlike Orgasm, this is more of a sheen and not full on glitter.  And I think the sheen is what makes this not over powering on my complexion.  If I put on a shade like Revlon Black Cherry, with any other blush I own, I look goth.  I put it on with Sin, I look sophisticated, luxe, refined, old Hollywood.

"This is my 3rd NARS blush and I have to say it's one of my ultimate favs. The color is a pink peach with gold shimmer but like was said you won't be a disco ball. When I applied this and I barely touched the pan the color came out so amazing on my skin. I'm a NW-15-20 and this is just great on my skin tone. It looked like it belonged and like others said no matter what eye makeup this color goes with it!! I love that it doesn't have any glitter because i prefer something like NARS O to go out this is more a daytime anytime blush.

It applies like a dream and for me it lasted a long time like 8 hours long. I could have touched it up but the fade was a nice glow.Another cool thing is this blush looks very natural for the amount of shimmer. I took some pics and it looks fantastic in pictures ie, natural:) I do think I am a NARS blush convert as I can't see myself using something else because the quality is so good. The payoff is excellent and for me it lasts. This is one of those blushes that I feel I'll never hit the pan on because you only need a little. 

I can see how this can be a universal color because a couple more swipes and I can see how easily it would work on darker skin tones.

"This is the most raved about product of NARS, besides the foundation i guess. BUT.. I totally agree with the reviewer downstairs.. the packaging.. I mean won't can't you make it hard plastic non rubbery container to have these blushes in?? I just can't understand HOW hard can that be?? 

As for the product it self... It's nice when i swatch it on my hand, but as I walked around cosmetics shops in either high ends to drug store products there are so many similar coloured blushes which costs 1/6 of its price. In AUSTRALIA it costs AUD $60.. I think it's Insane because Chanel foundation only costed me $69... ><

"I've finally sucumbed to the hype of this blush.  I have avoided wearing blush for years since it always looks clownish on me.  So, anyway I purchased this and gave it a try.  I have light to medium skin and the  blush colour is very pigmented and long lasting on my skin.  I love the fresh glow it gives me as I can look tired and haggard with just my MMU.   I think my method of application is the trick to making this work for me.  I apply to bare skin so that the colour looks just a little overdone.  Then I apply my powder MMU overtop of the blush and when that is done, the blush colour has been toned down and blended very well.  The powder MMU also seems to tone down the gold shimmer too, so just a little glow with a nice flushed look is the final result.  
This blush applied over top of my MMU is too intense and I look like I've climbed a mountain, but applied underneath my MMU, it's perfect and lasts all day and evening.  I only apply once a day, so I keep the package in the little cardboard box it comes in and it's staying clean.

"I'm so glad I purchased this. I personally adore Nars blushes so when I new one comes out I have to find out about it. Dolce Vita was no exception.

"Man .. I don't even know where to start in reviewing this piece of delicious-ness.  Taj Mahal was one of the first NARS blushes I acquired, and while I don't reach for it often, my heart just goes pitter patter when it's a ""taj-mahal-kinda-day"".  This blush is not for someone that wants an understated classic makeup look .. this puppy is BRIGHT ... it's orange .. it's B-O-L-D!!  What I love about it .. it's unique.  I have over 80 blushes, and this is the ONE blush in my collection that I can honestly say, is unlike any other blush I have.  It's in absolutely infused with mind-blowingly beautiful gold shimmer.  I'm a MMM/NC42, even I have to use a skunk brush with this thing.  Would I repurchase .. YES, if I live 50 lifetimes to actually finish this!  With this blush, you barely touch your brush to it, and it's enough to cover your cheeks, your neighbors cheeks, and the cheeks around the block!  I rest my case!

"As mentioned before-- use a light hand with this one, especially if you are fair skinned. I overdid it the first time and since Nars lasts and lasts, I really had to wipe with a towel to remove it, and then I'd removed my foundation too. That out of the way, Sin is a beautiful color on me, puplish, brownish, plum with a hint of shimmer. I have Nars Douceur and in the Sephora store lighting, these two blushes looked kind of similar.  That's the only similarity though. Douceur is browner, matte and pretty sheer, a buildable color and great for contour. Sin is a very pigmented color, just a little goes a long way so I don't see myself hitting pan on this one for a loooong time.  I love the petite Nars packaging, it is slim and fits well into my makeup bag, luckily a little goes a long way because at $27 apiece, Nars blushes are pretty expensive. I have a couple of Tarte blushes which are also highly rated (and pricey!)  and a MAC color,  but I find myself reaching for the Nars most of the time.",0.7096774193548387,0.6666666666666643,a mentioned before use a light hand with this one especially if you are fair skinned i overdid it the first time and since nars last and last i really had to wipe with a towel to remove it and then i would removed my foundation too that out of the way sin is a beautiful color on me puplish brownish plum with a hint of shimmer i have nars douceur and in the sephora store lighting these two blush looked kind of similar that is the only similarity though douceur is browner matte and pretty sheer a buildable color and great for contour sin is a very pigmented color just a little go a long way so i do not see myself hitting pan on this one for a loooong time i love the petite nars packaging it is slim and fit well into my makeup bag luckily a little go a long way because at apiece nars blush are pretty expensive i have a couple of tarte blush which are also highly rated and pricey and a mac color but i find myself reaching for the nars most of the time,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.9604045079492856,0.6533333333333333,0.2096069868995633,0.191969887076537,0.259848806591353,0.3140216682646215,0.4716385218683884,mentioned use light hand one especially fair skinned overdid first time since last last really wipe towel remove would removed foundation way sin beautiful puplish brownish plum hint shimmer douceur sephora store lighting two looked kind similar similarity though douceur browner matte pretty sheer buildable great contour sin pigmented little go long way see hitting pan one loooong time love petite packaging slim fit well makeup bag luckily little go long way apiece pretty expensive couple tarte also highly rated pricey mac find reaching time,3
"Angelika looks very intimidating in the pan as I'm not a huge fan of shimmer or glitter. Despite that, I think this is a perfectly useable blush. It's a bright, cool blue-based pink with silver glimmers throughout. Pigmented and blendable. I tap off the excess from my brush and that minimizes the amount of shimmer transferred to my face. Despite being cool toned, it works with my warm skin quite nicely and is fairly buildable. Similar to MAC pink swoon on me but with more depth. I like it but I wish the lasting power was better on the skin, considering the price.
